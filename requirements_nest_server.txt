# Required Python packages to run NEST Server.
#
# This file specifies the required Python packages to run NEST Server.
# It is meant for those who would like to compile NEST or build NEST
# documentation themselves. If you just want to execute NEST, you should
# install NEST directly as described in
# https://www.nest-simulator.org/installation.
#
# The listed requirements are used to build the mamba environment defined
# in the environment yaml file. If you want to run nest-server with mpi, please
# uncomment to install required packages. If you want to build an environment
# yourself, e.g., independent of mamba, the requirements from this file
# can be installed by
#
#     pip install -r requirements_nest_server.txt

Flask
flask-cors
gunicorn

# Uncomment next lines of packages for mpi:

# mpi4py
