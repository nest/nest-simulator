**Name:**
::

    poisson_generator - simulate neuron firing with Poisson processes
      statistics.

**Description:**
::


      The poisson_generator simulates a neuron that is firing with Poisson
      statistics, i.e. exponentially distributed interspike intervals. It will
      generate a _unique_ spike train for each of it's targets. If you do not want
      this behavior and need the same spike train for all targets, you have to use a
      parrot neuron inbetween the poisson generator and the targets.



**Parameters:**
::


      The following parameters appear in the element's status dictionary:

      rate    double - mean firing rate in Hz
      origin   double    - Time origin for device timer in ms
      start   double - begin of device application with resp. to origin in ms
      stop    double - end of device application with resp. to origin in ms



**Sends:**
::

    SpikeEvent



**Remarks:**
::


      A Poisson generator may, especially at high rates, emit more than one
      spike during a single time step. If this happens, the generator does
      not actually send out n spikes. Instead, it emits a single spike with
      n-fold synaptic weight for the sake of efficiency.

      The design decision to implement the Poisson generator as a device
      which sends spikes to all connected nodes on every time step and then
      discards the spikes that should not have happened generating random
      numbers at the recipient side via an event hook is twofold.

      On one hand, it leads to the saturation of the messaging network with
      an enormous amount of spikes, most of which will never get delivered
      and should not have been generated in the first place.

      On the other hand, a proper implementation of the Poisson generator
      needs to provide two basic features: (a) generated spike trains
      should be IID processes w.r.t. target neurons to which the generator
      is connected and (b) as long as virtual_num_proc is constant, each
      neuron should receive an identical Poisson spike train in order to
      guarantee reproducibility of the simulations across varying machine
      numbers.

      Therefore, first, as Network::get_network().send sends spikes to all the
      recipients, differentiation has to happen in the hook, second, the
      hook can use the RNG from the thread where the recipient neuron sits,
      which explains the current design of the generator. For details,
