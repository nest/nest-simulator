Part 4: Spatially structured networks
=====================================

Introduction
------------

This section covers how to use NEST to construct
structured networks. When you have worked through this material you will
be able to:

-  Create populations of neurons with specific spatial locations
-  Define connectivity profiles between these types of populations
-  Connect populations using profiles
-  Visualize the connectivity

For more information on the usage of PyNEST, please see the other
sections of this tutorial:

- :ref:`Part 1: Neurons and simple neural networks <pynest_tutorial_1>`
- :ref:`Part 2: Populations of neurons <pynest_tutorial_2>`
- :ref:`Part 3: Connecting networks with synapses <pynest_tutorial_3>`

More advanced examples can be found at :ref:`Example
Networks <pynest_examples>`, or
have a look at the source directory of your NEST installation in the
subdirectory: ``pynest/examples/``.

Incorporating structure in networks of point neurons
----------------------------------------------------

If we use biologically detailed models of a neuron, then it's easy to
understand and implement the concepts of spatial networks, as we already have
dendritic arbors, axons, etc. which are the physical prerequisites for
connectivity within the nervous system. However, we can still get a
level of specificity using networks of point neurons.

Structure, both in the topological and everyday sense, can be thought of
as a set of rules governing the location of objects and the connections
between them. Within networks of point neurons, we can distinguish
between three types of specificity:

-  Cell-type specificity – what sorts of cells are there?
-  Location specificity – where are the cells?
-  Projection specificity – which cells do they project to, and how?

In the previous sections, we saw that we can create deterministic or
randomly selected connections between networks using :py:func:`.Connect`. Likewise, it is
also possible to use :py:func:`.Create` and :py:func:`.Connect` to create network
models that incorporate spatial location and spatial connectivity
profiles.

.. note::
   For comprehensive documentation of spatial properties and connectivity, see the :ref:`spatial_networks`.

Adding spatial information to populations
-----------------------------------------

NEST allows us to create populations of nodes with a given spatial
structure, connection profiles which specify how neurons are to be
connected, and provides a high-level connection routine. We can thus
create structured networks by designing the connection profiles to give
the desired specificity for cell-type, location and projection.

The generation of structured networks is carried out in three steps,
each of which will be explained in the subsequent sections in more
detail:

1. **Defining spatially distributed nodes**, in which we assign the layout and types of the
   neurons within a layer of our network.

2. **Defining connection specifications**, where we specify the parameters
   for connecting we wish our connections to have. Each connection
   dictionary specifies the properties for one class of connection, and
   contains parameters that allow us to tune the profile. These are
   related to the location-dependent likelihood of choosing a target
   (``mask`` and ``p``).

3. **Connecting nodes**, in which we apply the connection specifications
   between nodes, equivalent to population-specificity. A spatially distributed node can be
   connected to itself.

4. **Auxillary**, in which we visualise the results of the above steps
   either by ``nest.PrintNodes()`` or visualization functions and query
   the connections for further analysis.

Defining spatially distributed nodes
------------------------------------

The code for defining nodes with spatial distributions follows this template:

::

    import nest
    positions = ...  # See below for how to define positions
    s_nodes = nest.Create(node_model, positions=positions)

where ``positions`` will define the locations of the elements.

The ``node_model`` is the model type of the neuron, which can either be an
existing model in the ``NEST`` collection, or one that we've previously
defined using :py:func:`.CopyModel`.

We next have to decide whether the nodes should be placed in a
**grid-based** or **free** (off-grid) fashion, which is equivalent to
asking "can the elements of our network be regularly and evenly
placed within a 2D/3D network, or do we need to tell them where they should
be located?".

1 - On-grid
~~~~~~~~~~~

We have to explicitly specify the spacing of the grid with shape=[n, m],
where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns. It might be
easier to think of shape as shape=[nx, ny], where nx is number of elements in
x-direction and ny is number of directions in y-direction.
The size (*extent*) of the layer has a default size of 1 x 1, but this you can also set yourself.
The grid spacing *i* is determined from *m*, *n* and *extent*, and  *n* x *m* elements
are arranged symmetrically. Note that we can also specify a center to
the grid, else the default offset is the origin.

The following snippet produces :numref:`grid`:

::

    positions = nest.spatial.grid(shape=[10, 10]  # the number of rows and column in this grid ...
                                  extent=[2., 2.]  # the size of the grid in mm
                                  )
    nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', positions=positions)

2 - Off-grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more flexibility in how we distribute neurons, we can use free spatial
placement. We then need to define a Parameter for the placement of the
neurons, or we can define the positions of the neurons explicitly. Note
that the extent is calculated from the positions of the nodes, but we can
also explicitly specify it. See the *Free layers* section of the
:ref:`spatial_networks`
for details.

The following snippet produces :numref:`free`:

::

    positions = nest.spatial.free(
        nest.random.uniform(min=-0.5, max=0.5),  # using random positions in a uniform distribution
        num_dimensions=2  # have to specify number of dimensions
    )
    s_nodes = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', 100, positions=positions)

Note that we have to specify the number of dimensions as we are using a
random parameter for the positions. The number of dimensions can be either
2 or 3. If we specify extent or use an explicit array of positions, the
number of dimensions is deduced by NEST. Also note that when creating the
nodes, we specify the number of neurons to be created. This is not
necessary when using an array of positions.

See the table of *Spatially-structured specific NEST parameters* in the
:ref:`spatial_networks`
for a selection of NEST Parameters that can be used.

The following is an example of how to create off-grid nodes with a list of positions. It will create
nodes with a grid+jitter structure.

::

    xs = np.arange(-0.5, 0.501, 0.1)
    poss = [[x, y] for y in xs for x in xs]
    poss = [[p[0] + np.random.uniform(-0.03, 0.03), p[1] + np.random.uniform(-0.03, 0.03)] for p in poss]

    positions = nest.spatial.free(poss)
    s_nodes = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', positions=positions)


Defining connection profiles
----------------------------

To define the types of connections that we want between populations of
neurons, we specify a *connection dictionary*.

The connection dictionary for connecting populations with spatial
information is the same as when connecting populations without spatial
information, but with a few optional additions. If the connection ``rule``
is one of ``pairwise_bernoulli``, ``fixed_indegree`` or
``fixed_outdegree``, one may specify some additional parameters that
allows us to tune our connectivity profiles by tuning the likelihood of a
connection, the number of connections, or defining a subset of the nodes
to connect.

The *Connections* section in the
:ref:`spatial_networks`
deals comprehensively with all the different possibilities, and it's suggested
that you look there for learning about the different constraints, as well
as reading through the different examples listed there. Here are some
representative examples for setting up a connectivity profile, and the
following table lists the parameters that can be used.

Connecting spatially distributed nodes
--------------------------------------

Connecting spatially distributed nodes is the easiest step: having defined a source population, a
target population and a connection dictionary, we simply use
``nest.Connect()``:

::

    ex_pop = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', positions=nest.spatial.grid(shape=[4, 5]))
    in_pop = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', positions=nest.spatial.grid(shape=[5, 4]))
    conn_dict_ex = {'rule': 'pairwise_bernoulli',
                    'p': 1.0,
                    'mask': {'circular': {'radius': 0.5}}}
    # And now we connect E->I
    nest.Connect(ex_pop, in_pop, conn_dict_ex)

Note that we can use the same dictionary multiple times and connect to the
same population:

::

    # Extending the code from above ... we add a conn_dict for inhibitory neurons
    conn_dict_in = {'rule': 'pairwise_bernoulli',
                    'p': 1.0,
                    'mask': {'circular': {'radius': 0.75}},
                    'weight': -4.}
    # And finish connecting the rest of the populations:
    nest.Connect(ex_pop, ex_pop, conn_dict_ex)
    nest.Connect(in_pop, in_pop, conn_dict_in)
    nest.Connect(in_pop, ex_pop, conn_dict_in)

Visualising and querying the network structure
------------------------------------------------

There are two main methods that we can use for checking that our network
was built correctly:

-  ``nest.PrintNodes()``

   which prints the node ID ranges and model names of the nodes in the
   network.

-  Create plots using the following functions:

   -  ``nest.PlotLayer()``
   -  ``nest.PlotTargets()``
   -  ``nest.PlotSources()``
   -  ``nest.PlotProbabilityParameter()``

   which allow us to generate the plots used with NUTM and this handout.
   See the *Visualization functions* section in our :ref:`spatial_networks`
   for more details.

It may also be useful to look at the ``.spatial`` property of the
NodeCollection, which describes the spatial properties.

>>>  ex_pop.spatial
     {'center': (0.0, 0.0),
      'edge_wrap': False,
      'extent': (1.0, 1.0),
      'network_size': 20,
      'shape': (4, 5)}

It may also be useful to look at the ``spatial`` property of the
NodeCollection, which describes the layer properties.
