/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_multimeter - Minimal test for correct multimeter setup
 
Synopsis: (test_multimeter) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
  This test provides a minimal check for correct multimeter setup.
 
  For each model with a "recordables" property, it creates an instance,
  connects a multimeter to them requestin all properties, simulates briefly
  and checks that the correct number of data items is collected for each
  recordable.
 
  This test mainly ensures that init_buffers_() initializes the data logger.
  If a developer has forgotten to add recordables to get_status(), this test
  will ignore the pertaining neuron.
