Name: length_lp - counts elements of a literal procedure

Synopsis:

literal procedure length_lp -> int


Examples:

{ {1 2 3} } 0 get length_lp -> 3


Remarks:

0 get is needed to make sure that procedure is still 
literal procedure, when it is evaluated. Use length if you are 
not sure of the data type.
