IAF Neuron example
------------------

A DC current is injected into the neuron using a current generator
device. The membrane potential as well as the spiking activity are
recorded by corresponding devices.

It can be observed how the current charges the membrane, a spike
is emitted, the neuron becomes absolute refractory, and finally
starts to recover.

KEYWORDS:

First, we import all necessary modules for simulation and plotting


.. code-block:: default


    import nest
    import pylab


Second the Function build_network is defined to build the network and
return the handles of the spike detector and the voltmeter


.. code-block:: default



    def build_network(dt):

        nest.ResetKernel()
        nest.SetKernelStatus({"local_num_threads": 1, "resolution": dt})

        neuron = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha')
        nest.SetStatus(neuron, "I_e", 376.0)

        vm = nest.Create('voltmeter')
        nest.SetStatus(vm, "withtime", True)

        sd = nest.Create('spike_detector')

        nest.Connect(vm, neuron)
        nest.Connect(neuron, sd)

        return vm, sd


The function build_network takes the resolution as argument.
First the Kernel is reset and the number of threads is set to zero as well
 as the resolution to the specified value dt.  The iaf_psc_alpha is
created and the handle is stored in the variable neuron The status of the
neuron is changed so it receives an external current.  Next the voltmeter
is created and the handle stored in vm and the option 'withtime' is set,
therefore times are given in the times vector in events. Now the
spike_detecor is created and its handle is stored in sd.

Voltmeter and spikedetector are then connected to the neuron. The connect
 function takes the handles as input.  The Voltmeter is connected to the
neuron and the neuron to the spikedetector because the neuron sends spikes
 to the detector and the voltmeter 'observes' the neuron.

The neuron is simulated for three different resolutions and then the
voltage trace is plotted


.. code-block:: default

        print("Running simulation with dt=%.2f" % dt)
