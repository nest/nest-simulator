   Test for Ticket 643.

   This test verifies that:

   If connection counts sometimes become zero due to
   incorrect counting, min_delay / max_delay get computed wrongly and the
   things tentatively called ring buffers are not allocated
   correctly. Subsequently, an out of bounds access crashes the
   simulation.
