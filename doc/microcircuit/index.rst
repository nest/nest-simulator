Microcircuit Model
===================

This is a PyNEST implementation of the cortical microcircuit model by Potjans
and Diesmann [1]_.  The network model represents 4 layers of cortex, L2/3, L4, L5,
and L6, each consisting of 2 populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
The original sli version can be found `here <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/tree/master/examples/nest/Potjans_2014>`__.
