NEST is a simulator for **spiking neural network models**, ideal for networks of any size, for example:

1.  Models of information processing e.g., in the visual or auditory cortex of
    mammals,

2.  Models of network activity dynamics, e.g., laminar cortical networks or
    balanced random networks,

3.  Models of learning and plasticity.

**New to NEST?**
    Start here at our :ref:`getting_started` page


**Know which model you need?**
    NEST comes packaged with a large collection of neuron and synaptic plasticity models.
    You can find a list of all available models in our :doc:`model directory <models/index>`,
    or select a model category by clicking one of the images:

If you use NEST for your project, don't forget to :ref:`cite NEST <cite_nest>`!

**Need a different model?**
    To customize or combine features of neuron and synapse models, we recommend
    using the `NESTML modeling language <https://nestml.readthedocs.io/>`_.

**Have a question or issue with NEST?**
    See our :ref:`Getting Help <getting_help>` page.

Where to find what
------------------

* :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>` show you step by step instructions using NEST. If you haven't used NEST before, the PyNEST tutorial is a good place to start.

* :ref:`Example Networks <pynest_examples>`  demonstrate the use of dozens of the neural network models implemented in NEST.

* :ref:`Topical Guides <toc_guides>` provide deeper insight into several topics and concepts from :ref:`Parallel Computing <parallel_computing>`
  to handling :ref:`Gap Junction Simulations <sim_gap_junctions>` and :ref:`setting up a spatially-structured network <spatial_networks>`.

* :ref:`Reference Material <pynest_api>` provides a quick look up of definitions, functions and terms.
