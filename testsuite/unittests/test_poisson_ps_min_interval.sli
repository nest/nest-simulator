/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_poisson_ps_min_interval - checks that intervals are independent of tic size

Synopsis: (test_poisson_ps_min_interval) run -> minimum interal close to 0

Description:
 The inter spike interval (ISI) distribution of a Poisson process is 
 exponential. The test verifies that the minimum interval is arbitrarily 
 small and not constrained by the ms_per_tic property of the simlation kernel.
Remarks:
 Even a correct implementation generates with low probability spike trains where the
 minimal interval is larger than ms_per_tic. The seed set in the default configuration 
 of NEST avoids this problem. Therefore, failure of this script indicates that the
 configuration is not portable.
