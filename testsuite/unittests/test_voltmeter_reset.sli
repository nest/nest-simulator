 /** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_voltmeter_reset - test if resetting works on voltmeter

Synopsis: (test_voltmeter_reset) run -> dies if assertion fails

Description:
	Voltmeter records from iaf_psc_alpha to memory, checks if proper number
	of data points is acquired, deleted on reset, and recorded again on
	further simulation. This test ascertains that also data stored in the
	derived recorder class, not only in RecordingDevice, is reset.
