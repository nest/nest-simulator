   Name: testsuite::test_getnodes - sli script to test if GetGlobalNodes works as expected

   Synopsis: (test_getnodes) run

   Description:

   This test generates 10 iaf_psc_alpha, 10 iaf_psc_delta and 10
   iaf_psc_exp neurons. It then uses GetGlobalNodes to retrieve these
   different sets of neurons from the network.
