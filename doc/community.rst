NEST Community
===============


Mailing List
-------------

The NEST users mailing list is intended to be a forum for questions on the usage
of NEST, the exchange of code and general discussions about NEST. The philosophy
is that all users profit by sharing their experience. All NEST core developers
are subscribed to this list and will participate in the discussions as far as
time allows.

For more information, subscription instructions and access to the archives,
please visit https://www.nest-initiative.org/mailinglist/.


Contributing to NEST
---------------------

NEST draws its strength from the many people that use and improve it. We
are happy to consider your contributions (e.g. own models, bug or
documentation fixes) for addition to the official version of NEST.

Please see the `NEST developer
space <http://nest.github.io/nest-simulator>`_ for information about
the development workflow of NEST and for how to create a fork of our Git
repository and make pull requests against it.

Reporting bugs
--------------

The primary place to go to if you find an error is the `GitHub issue
tracker for NEST <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues>`_.
Please take the time to check if your issue has already been reported
there before creating a new one.

To make it easier for the developers to understand and solve the
problem, please include the following information in your bug report, if
applicable:

1. Release version or Git revision of NEST.

2. Platform and operating system version.

3. The file ``config.log`` from the build directory and the output of
   the configure script.

4. The contents of the ``reports`` directory in the build directory.
