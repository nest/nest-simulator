NEST Community
===============

Mailing List
-------------

The NEST users mailing list is intended to be a forum for questions on the usage
of NEST, the exchange of code and general discussions about NEST.  The philosophy
is that all users profit by sharing their experience. All NEST core developers
are subscribed to this list and will participate in the discussions as far as
time allows.

By subscribing to the mailing list you will also get notified of all NEST related events!

For more information, subscription instructions and access to the archives,
please visit https://www.nest-initiative.org/mailinglist/.

Open video meeting for users and developers
--------------------------------------------

Every two weeks, we have an open video meeting to discuss current issues and developments in NEST.
We welcome our users to join who may have questions regarding their implementations or issues they want help solving.
This is an opportunity to have discussions in real time with developers.

Information for dates and how to join can be found on `our GitHub wiki <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/wiki/Open-NEST-Developer-Video-Conference>`_

Publications using NEST

We have compiled  a `list of NEST-related peer-reviewed publications <https://www.nest-simulator.org/publications/>`_ that
we update regularly.
