# `models` folder

This directory contains all files required to define the standard set
of models shipped with NEST. All these models are combined into the
ModelsModule, which is loaded into NEST automatically.

The code is linked as a static library.

Please do not use this module as an example for your own modules. See
https://github.com/nest/nest-extension-module instead.
