/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_stop - test if SLI returns exit code 126 when executing a file with a software interrupt.

Synopsis: (test_stop) run ->

Description:
This script calls the SLI command `stop` that is not handled by any
user error handler. This is a rarely used feature of SLI called
"software interrupt". This scipt is used to test if SLI quits with
exit code 126 after executing a file that causes a software
interrupt.

Author: Ruediger Kupper

FirstVersion: 03-jul-2008

Remarks:
Yes, this script is really meant to fail due to an unhandled software interrupt.

% Yes, this script contains a stop without error handler. That's intentional.
% And no, there shall be no stopped context around this error. Really.

%call unhandled stop (cause software interrupt):
stop
