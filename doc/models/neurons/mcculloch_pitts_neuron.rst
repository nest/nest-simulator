**Name:**
::

    mcculloch_pitts_neuron - Binary deterministic neuron with Heaviside  
      activation function.

**Description:**
::

     
      The mcculloch_pitts_neuron is an implementation of a binary  
      neuron that is irregularly updated as Poisson time points [1]. At  
      each update point the total synaptic input h into the neuron is  
      summed up, passed through a Heaviside gain function g(h) = H(h-theta),  
      whose output is either 1 (if input is above) or 0 (if input is below  
      threshold theta).  
      The time constant tau_m is defined as the  
      mean inter-update-interval that is drawn from an exponential  
      distribution with this parameter. Using this neuron to reprodce  
      simulations with asynchronous update [1], the time constant needs  
      to be chosen as tau_m = dt*N, where dt is the simulation time  
      step and N the number of neurons in the original simulation with  
      asynchronous update. This ensures that a neuron is updated on  
      average every tau_m ms. Since in the original paper [1] neurons  
      are coupled with zero delay, this implementation follows this  
      definition. It uses the update scheme described in [3] to  
      maintain causality: The incoming events in time step t_i are  
      taken into account at the beginning of the time step to calculate  
      the gain function and to decide upon a transition.  In order to  
      obtain delayed coupling with delay d, the user has to specify the  
      delay d+h upon connection, where h is the simulation time step.  
       
      

**Parameters:**
::

     
      tau_m   double - Membrane time constant (mean inter-update-interval)  
      in ms.  
      theta   double - threshold for sigmoidal activation function mV  
       
      

**Receives:**
::

    SpikeEvent, PotentialRequest  
      

**Sends:**
::

    SpikeEvent  
      

**Remarks:**
::

     
      This neuron has a special use for spike events to convey the  
      binary state of the neuron to the target. The neuron model  
      only sends a spike if a transition of its state occurs. If the  
      state makes an up-transition it sends a spike with multiplicity 2,  
      if a down transition occurs, it sends a spike with multiplicity 1.  
      The decoding scheme relies on the feature that spikes with multiplicity  
      larger 1 are delivered consecutively, also in a parallel setting.  
      The creation of double connections between binary neurons will  
      destroy the decoding scheme, as this effectively duplicates  
      every event. Using random connection routines it is therefore  
      advisable to set the property 'multapses' to false.  
      The neuron accepts several sources of currents, e.g. from a  
      noise_generator.
