distance: _DistanceParameter
"""
A singleton instance representing the distance between two nodes in space.

If used alone, the DistanceObject represents simply the Euclidean
distance between two nodes.

Alternatively the distance in a single dimension may be chosen. Three
properties are defined, x, y, and z, which represent the distance in
their respective dimensions. Note that the distance parameter can only
be used in contexts with two nodes, e.g. when connecting.
