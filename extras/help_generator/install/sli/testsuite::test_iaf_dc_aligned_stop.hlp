Name: testsuite::test_iaf_dc_aligned_stop - sli script for test of iaf_neuron resolution independence

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_dc_aligned_stop) run -> compare response with reference data


Description:

test_iaf_dc_aligned_stop.sli is an extended version of 
test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay.sli . In addition to the time when the 
current is switched on (/start) (test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay.sli) also 
a finite duration of the current is specified. This is done by 
supplying the DC generator device with the time stamp of the 
earliest DC event that should not be emitted.  Consequently, stop = 
start + duration. 
In the step stop	- h -> stop, no DC event is emitted anymore. A neuron 
connected to the DC generator interprets this as a DC current that is 
switched off precisely at time stop. Therefore, the DC current specified 
by start and stop is independent of the resolution h. The minimal duration 
is h. 
See [1] for details on why the DC generator specification is 
consistent with a grid based integration scheme of systems of 
differential equations.  In this scheme DC currents are represeted 
by the differential equation d/dt I = 0. 
The resulting SLI code is independent of the resolution and 
generates exactly the same voltage trace at all resolutions. 
No output of the spike detector is visible here because of the short 
stimulation period of 2 ms. 
The expected output is documented at the end of the script.
