.. card:: Mailing list

  The NEST users mailing list is intended to be a forum for questions on the usage
  of NEST, the exchange of code and general discussions about NEST.  The philosophy
  is that all users profit by sharing their experience. All NEST core developers
  are subscribed to this list and will participate in the discussions as far as
  time allows.
