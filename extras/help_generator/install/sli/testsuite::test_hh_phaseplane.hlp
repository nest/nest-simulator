Name: testsuite::test_hh_phaseplane - sli script for hh_psc_alpha model

Synopsis:

(test_hh_phaseplane) run -> 'phaseplane.txt' & 'AP.txt'


Description:

test_hh_phaseplane makes a numerical phase-plane analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron 
(iaf_psc_alpha). Dynamics is investigated in the V-n space (see remark below). A constant 
DC can be specified  and its influence on the nullclines can be studied. 
Results are written into two files. 'phaseplane.txt' contains the phase-plane data as a 
vector field and 'AP.txt' the trace of a single action potential as one possible 
numerical solution in the vector field. The data files are used in the matlab-script hh_phaseplane.m 
REMARK 
To make the two-dimensional analysis possible, the (four-dimensional) 
Hodgkin-Huxley formalism needs to be artificially reduced to two dimensions, 
in this case by 'clamping' the two other variables, m an h, to 
constant values (m_eq and h_eq).
