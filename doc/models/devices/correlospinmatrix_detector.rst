**Name:**
::

    correlospinmatrix_detector - Device for measuring the covariance matrix  
      from several inputs

**Description:**
::

    The correlospinmatrix_detector is a recording device. It is used  
      to record correlations from binary neurons from several binary sources and  
      calculates the raw auto and cross correlation binned to bins of duration  
      delta_tau. The result can be obtained via GetStatus under the key  
      /count_covariance. The result is a tensor of rank 3 of size  
      N_channels x N_channels, with each entry C_ij being a vector of size  
      2*tau_max/delta_tau + 1 containing the histogram for the different time lags.  
       
      The bins are centered around the time difference they represent, and are  
      left-closed and right-open in the lower triangular part of the matrix. On the  
      diagonal and in the upper triangular part the intervals are left-open and  
      right-closed. This ensures proper counting of events at the border of bins.  
       
      The correlospinmatrix_detector has a variable number of inputs which can be  
      set via SetStatus under the key N_channels. All incoming connections to a  
      specified receptor will be pooled.  
       
      

**Parameters:**
::

     
      Tstart  double     - Time when to start counting events. This time should  
      be set to at least start + tau_max in order to avoid  
      edge effects of the correlation counts.  
      Tstop    double     - Time when to stop counting events. This time should be  
      set to at most Tsim    - tau_max, where Tsim is the  
      duration of simulation, in order to avoid edge effects  
      of the correlation counts.  
      delta_tau  double    - bin width in ms. This has to be a multiple of the  
      resolution.  
      tau_max   double    - one-sided width in ms. In the lower triangular part  
      events with differences in [0, tau_max+delta_tau/2)  
      are counted. On the diagonal and in the upper  
      triangular part events with differences in (0,  
      tau_max+delta_tau/2]  
      N_channels long     - The number of inputs to correlate. This defines the  
      range of receptor_type. Default is 1.  
       
      count_covariance matrix of long vectors, read-only      - raw, auto/cross  
      correlation counts  
       
      

**Receives:**
::

    SpikeEvent  
       
      

**Remarks:**
::

    This recorder does not record to file, screen or memory in the usual  
      sense. The result must be obtained by a call to GetStatus. Setting either  
      N_channels, Tstart, Tstop, tau_max or delta_tau clears count_covariance.
