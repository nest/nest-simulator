# Part 3: Connecting networks with synapses

## Introduction

In this handout we look at using synapse models to connect neurons. After you
have worked through this material, you will know how to:

-   set synapse model parameters before creation
-   define synapse models with customised parameters
-   use synapse models in connection routines
-   query the synapse values after connection
-   set synapse values during and after connection

For more information on the usage of PyNEST, please see the other sections of
this primer: 

-   [Part 1: Neurons and simple neural networks](part-1-neurons-and-simple-neural-networks.md)
-   [Part 2: Populations of neurons](part-2-populations-of-neurons.md)
-   [Part 4: Topologically structured networks](part-4-topologically-structured-networks.md)

More advanced examples can be found at [Example Networks](http://www.nest-simulator.org/more-example-networks/), or have a 
look at at the source directory of your NEST installation in the 
subdirectory: `pynest/examples/`. 

## Parameterising synapse models

NEST provides a variety of different synapse models. You can see the available
models by using the command `Models(synapses)`, which picks only the synapse
models out of the list of all available models.

Synapse models can be parameterised analogously to neuron models. You can
discover the default parameter settings using `GetDefaults(model)` and set them
with `SetDefaults(model,params)`:

    nest.SetDefaults("stdp_synapse",{"tau_plus": 15.0})

Any synapse generated from this model will then have all the standard parameters
except for the `tau_plus`, which will have the value given above.

Moreover, we can also create customised variants of synapse models using
`CopyModel()`, exactly as demonstrated for neuron models:

    nest.CopyModel("stdp_synapse","layer1_stdp_synapse",{"Wmax": 90.0})

Now `layer1_stdp_synapse` will appear in the list returned by `Models()`, and
can be used anywhere that a built-in model name can be used.

### STDP synapses

For the majority of synapses, all of their parameters are accessible via
`GetDefaults()` and `SetDefaults()`. Synapse models implementing spike-timing
dependent plasticity are an exception to this, as their dynamics are driven by
the post-synaptic spike train as well as the pre-synaptic one. As a consequence,
the time constant of the depressing window of STDP is a parameter of the 
post-synaptic neuron. It can be set as follows:

    nest.Create("iaf_psc_alpha", params={"tau_minus": 30.0})

or by using any of the other methods of parameterising neurons demonstrated in
the first two parts of this introduction.

## Connecting with synapse models

The synapse model as well as parameters associated with the synapse type can be
set in the synapse specification dictionary accepted by the connection routine.

    conn_dict = {"rule": "fixed_indegree", "indegree": K}
    syn_dict = {"model": "stdp_synapse", "alpha": 1.0}
    nest.Connect(epop1, epop2, conn_dict, syn_dict)

If no synapse model is given, connections are made using the model
`static_synapse`.

## Distributing synapse parameters

The synapse parameters are specified in the synapse dictionary which is 
passed to the `Connect`-function. If the parameter is set to a scalar all 
connections will be drawn using the same parameter. Parameters can be 
randomly distributed by assigning a dictionary to the parameter. The 
dictionary has to contain the key `distribution` setting the target 
distribution of the parameters (for example `normal`). Optionally, parameters 
associated with the distribution can be set (for example `mu`). Here we show 
an example where the parameters `alpha` and `weight` of the stdp synapse are 
uniformly distributed.

    alpha_min = 0.1
    alpha_max = 2.
    w_min = 0.5 
    w_max = 5.
    
    syn_dict = {"model": "stdp_synapse", 
                "alpha": {"distribution": "uniform", "low": alpha_min, "high": alpha_max},
                "weight": {"distribution": "uniform", "low": w_min, "high": w_max},
                "delay": 1.0}
    nest.Connect(epop1, neuron, "all_to_all", syn_dict)


Available distributions and associated parameters are described in 
[Connection Management](connection-management.md), the most common ones are:

| Distributions  |        Keys      |
|--------------- |------------------|
| `normal`       | `mu`, `sigma`    |
| `lognormal`    | `mu`, `sigma`    |
| `uniform`      | `low`, `high`    |
| `uniform_int`  | `low`, `high`    |
| `binomial`     | `n`, `p`         |
| `exponential`  | `lambda`         |
| `gamma`        | `order`, `scale` |
| `poisson`      | `lambda`         |

## Querying the synapses

The function `GetConnections(source=None, target=None, synapse_model=None)`
returns a list of connection identifiers that match the given specifications.
There are no mandatory arguments. If it is called without any arguments, it will
return all the connections in the network. If `source` is specified, as a list
of one or more nodes, the function will return all outgoing connections from
that population:

    nest.GetConnections(epop1)

Similarly, we can find the incoming connections of a particular target
population by specifying `target` as a list of one or more nodes:

    nest.GetConnections(target=epop2)

will return all connections beween all neurons in the network and neurons in
`epop2`. Finally, the search can be restricted by specifying a given synapse
model:

    nest.GetConnections(synapse_model="stdp_synapse")

will return all the connections in the network which are of type `stdp_synapse`.
The last two cases are slower than the first case, as a full search of all
connections has to be performed.The arguments `source`, `target` and
`synapse_model` can be used individually, as above, or in any conjunction:

    nest.GetConnections(epop1, epop2, "stdp_synapse")

will return all the connections that the neurons in `epop1` have to neurons in
`epop2` of type `stdp_synapse`. Note that all these querying commands will only
return the local connections, i.e. those represented on that particular MPI
process in a distributed simulation.

Once we have the array of connections, we can extract data from it using
`GetStatus()`. In the simplest case, this returns a list of dictionaries,
containing the parameters and variables for each connection found by
`GetConnections`. However, usually we donâ€™t want all the information from a
synapse, but some specific part of it. For example, if we want to check we have
connected the network as intended, we might want to examine only the parameter
`target` of each connection. We can extract just this information by using the
optional `keys` argument of `GetStatus()`:

    conns = nest.GetConnections(epop1, synapse_model="stdp_synapse")
    targets = nest.GetStatus(conns, "target")

The variable `targets` is now list of all the `target` values of the connections
found. If we are interested in more than one parameter, `keys` can be a list of
keys as well:

    conns = nest.GetConnections(epop1, synapse_model="stdp_synapse")
    conn_vals = nest.GetStatus(conns, ["target","weight"])

The variable `conn_vals` is now a list of lists, containing the `target` and
`weight` values for each connection found.

To get used to these methods of querying the synapses, it is recommended to try
them out on a small network where all connections are known.

## Coding style

As your simulations become more complex, it is very helpful to develop a clean
coding style. This reduces the number of errors in the first place, but also
assists you to debug your code and makes it easier for others to understand it
(or even yourself after two weeks). Here are some pointers, some of which are
common to programming in general and some of which are more NEST specific.
Another source of useful advice is [PEP-8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/),
which, conveniently, can be automatically checked by many editors and IDEs.

### Numbers and variables

Simulations typically have lots of numbers in them - we use them to set
parameters for neuron models, to define the strengths of connections, the length
of simulations and so on. Sometimes we want to use the same parameters in
different scripts, or calculate some parameters based on the values of other
parameters. It is not recommended to hardwire the numbers into your scripts, as
this is error-prone: if you later decide to change the value of a given
parameter, you have to go through all your code and check that you have changed
every instance of it. This is particularly difficult to catch if the value is
being used in different contexts, for example to set a weight in one place and
to calculate the mean synaptic input in another.

A better approach is to set a variable to your parameter value, and then always
use the variable name every time the value is needed. It is also hard to follow
the code if the definitions of variables are spread throughout the script. If
you have a parameters section in your script, and group the variable names
according to function (e.g. neuronal parameters, synaptic parameters,
stimulation parameters,...) then it is much easier to find and check them.
Similarly, if you need to share parameters between simulation scripts, it is
much less error-prone to define all the variable names in a separate parameters
file, which the individual scripts can import. Thus a good rule of thumb is that
numbers should only be visible in distinct parameter files or parameter
sections, otherwise they should be represented by variables.

### Repetitive code, copy-and-paste, functions

Often you need to repeat a section of code with minor modifications. For
example, you have two `multimeter`s and you wish to extract the recorded
variable from each of them and then calculate its maximum. The temptation is to
write the code once, then copy-and-paste it to its new location and make any
necessary modifications:

    dma = nest.GetStatus(ma, keys="events")[0]
    Vma = dma["Vm"]
    amax = max(Vma)
    dmb = nest.GetStatus(mb, keys="events")[0]
    Vmb = dmb["Vm"]
    bmax = max(Vmb)
    print(amax-bmax)

There are two problems with this. First, it makes the main section of your code
longer and harder to follow. Secondly, it is error-prone. A certain percentage
of the time you will forget to make all the necessary modifications after the
copy-and-paste, and this will introduce errors into your code that are hard to
find, not only because they are semantically correct and so donâ€™t cause an
obvious error, but also because your eye tends to drift over them:

    dma = nest.GetStatus(multimeter1, keys="events")[0]
    Vma = dma["Vm"]
    amax = max(Vma)
    dmb = nest.GetStatus(multimeter2, keys="events")[0]
    Vmb = dmb["Vm"]
    bmax = max(Vma)
    print(amax-bmax)

The best way to avoid this is to define a function:

    def getMaxMemPot(Vdevice):
        dm = nest.GetStatus(Vdevice, keys="events")[0]
        return max(dm["Vm"])

Such helper functions can usefully be stored in their own section, analogous to
the parameters section. Now we can write down the functionality in a more
concise and less error-prone fashion:

    amax = getMaxMemPot(multimeter1)
    bmax = getMaxMemPot(multimeter2)
    print(amax-bmax)

If you find that this clutters your code, as an alternative you can write a
`lambda` function as an argument for `map`, and enjoy the feeling of smugness
that will pervade the rest of your day. A good policy is that if you find
yourself about to copy-and-paste more than one line of code, consider taking the
few extra seconds required to define a function. You will easily win this time
back by spending less time looking for errors.

### Subsequences and loops

When preparing a simulation or collecting or analysing data, it commonly happens
that we need to perform the same operation on each node (or a subset of nodes)
in a population. As neurons receive ids at the time of creation, it is possible
to use your knowledge of these ids explictly:

    Nrec = 50
    neuronpop = nest.Create("iaf_psc_alpha", 200)
    sd = nest.Create("spike_detector")
    nest.Connect(range(1,N_rec+1),sd,"all_to_all")

However, this is *not at all recommended!*. This is because as you develop your
simulation, you may well add additional nodes - this means that your initially
correct range boundaries are now incorrect, and this is an error that is hard to
catch. To get a subsequence of nodes, use a *slice* of the relevant population:

    nest.Connect(neuronpop[:Nrec],spikedetector,"all_to_all")

An even worse thing is to use knowledge about neuron ids to set up loops:

    for n in range(1,len(neuronpop)+1):
        nest.SetStatus([n], {"V_m": -67.0})

Not only is this error prone as in the previous example, the majority of PyNEST
functions are expecting a list anyway. If you give them a list, you are reducing
the complexity of your main script (good) and pushing the loop down to the
faster C++ kernel, where it will run more quickly (also good). Therefore,
instead you should write:

    nest.SetStatus(neuronpop, {"V_m": -67.0})

[See Part 2](part-2-populations-of-neurons.md) for more examples on 
operations on multiple neurons, such as setting the status from a random 
distribution and connecting populations.

If you really really need to loop over neurons, just loop over the population
itself (or a slice of it) rather than introducing ranges:

    for n in neuronpop:
        my_weird_function(n)

Thus we can conclude: instead of range operations, use slices of and loops over
the neuronal population itself. In the case of loops, check first whether you
can avoid it entirely by passing the entire population into the function - you
usually can.

## Command overview

These are the new functions we introduced for the examples in this handout.

### Querying Synapses

-   [`GetConnections(neuron, synapse_model="None"))`](http://www.nest-simulator.org/pynest-api/#lib-hl_api_connections-GetConnections)
    
    Return an array of connection identifiers.
    
    Parameters:
    
    - `source` - list of source GIDs
    - `target` - list of target GIDs
    - `synapse_model` - string with the synapse model
    
    If GetConnections is called without parameters, all connections in the 
    network are returned. If a list of source neurons is given, only 
    connections from these pre-synaptic neurons are returned. If a list of 
    target neurons is given, only connections to these post-synaptic neurons 
    are returned. If a synapse model is given, only connections with this 
    synapse type are returned. Any combination of source, target and 
    synapse\_model parameters is permitted. Each connection id is a 5-tuple 
    or, if available, a NumPy array with the following five entries:
    source-gid, target-gid, target-thread, synapse-id, port
    
    *Note:* Only connections with targets on the MPI process executing the 
    command are returned.
