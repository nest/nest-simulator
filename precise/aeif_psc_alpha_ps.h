Name: aeif_psc_alpha_ps - Current-based exponential integrate-and-fire
  neuron model according to Brette and Gerstner (2005), implementing precise
  spikes, as well as a linear interpolation to find the "exact" time where the
  threshold was crossed, i.e. the spiking time.

Description:
aeif_cond_alpha is the adaptive exponential integrate and fire neuron according
to Brette and Gerstner (2005) and synaptic currents are modelled as alpha
functions. This model implements precise spikes and a linear interpolation to
find spike times more precisely.

This implementation uses the embedded 4th order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg solver
with adaptive stepsize to integrate the differential equation.

The membrane potential is given by the following differential equation:

C dV/dt = -g_L*(V-E_L) + g_L*Delta_T*exp((V-V_T)/Delta_T) + I_ex(t) - I_in(t)
          - w + I_e

and

tau_w * dw/dt = a*(V-E_L) - w

Parameters:
The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary.

Dynamic state variables:
  V_m        double - Membrane potential in mV
  I_ex       double - Excitatory synaptic current in pA.
  dI_ex      double - First derivative of I_ex in pA/ms
  I_in       double - Inhibitory synaptic current in pA.
  dI_in      double - First derivative of I_in in pA/ms.
  w          double - Spike-adaptation current in pA.

Membrane Parameters:
  C_m        double - Capacity of the membrane in pF
  t_ref      double - Duration of refractory period in ms.
  V_reset    double - Reset value for V_m after a spike. In mV.
  E_L        double - Leak reversal potential in mV.
  g_L        double - Leak conductance in nS.
  I_e        double - Constant external input current in pA.

Spike adaptation parameters:
  a          double - Subthreshold adaptation in nS.
  b          double - Spike-triggered adaptation in pA.
  Delta_T    double - Slope factor in mV
  tau_w      double - Adaptation time constant in ms
  V_th       double - Spike initiation threshold in mV
  V_peak     double - Spike detection threshold in mV.

Synaptic parameters
  tau_syn_ex double - Rise time of excitatory synaptic current in ms (alpha
function).
  tau_syn_in double - Rise time of the inhibitory synaptic current in ms (alpha
function).

Integration parameters
  gsl_error_tol  double - This parameter controls the admissible error of the
GSL integrator.
                          Reduce it if NEST complains about numerical
instabilities.
