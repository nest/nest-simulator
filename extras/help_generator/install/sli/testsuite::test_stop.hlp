Name: testsuite::test_stop - test if SLI returns exit code 126 when executing a file with a software interrupt.

Synopsis:

(test_stop) run ->


Description:

This script calls the SLI command `stop` that is not handled by any 
user error handler. This is a rarely used feature of SLI called 
"software interrupt". This scipt is used to test if SLI quits with 
exit code 126 after executing a file that causes a software 
interrupt.


Remarks:

Yes, this script is really meant to fail due to an unhandled software interrupt.
