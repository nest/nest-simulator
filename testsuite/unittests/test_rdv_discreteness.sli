/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_rdv_discreteness - test discreteness of random distributions

Synopsis: (test_rdv_discreteness.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails

Description:
Test that discrete random distributions actually return integer values for
Random and RandomArray and continuous random distributions return double values
for Random and RandomArray.
