Recording backend `mpi` - Send data with MPI
############################################

Description
+++++++++++

.. admonition:: Availability

   This stimulation backend is only available if NEST was compiled with
   :ref:`support for MPI <compile-with-mpi>`.

The `mpi` recording backend sends collected data to a remote process
using MPI.

The name of the MPI port to send data to is read from a file for each
device configured to use this backend. The file needs to be named
according to the following pattern:

::

   {data_path}/{data_prefix}{label}/{node_id}.txt

The ``data_path`` and ``data_prefix`` are global kernel properties,
while `label` is a property of the device in question and `node_id`
its node ID. This path can only be set outside of a `Run` context
(i.e. after ``Prepare()`` has been called, but ``Cleanup()`` has not).

Communication Protocol
++++++++++++++++++++++

The following protocol is used to exchange information between both
MPI processes. The protocol is described using the following format
for the MPI messages: (value, number, type, source/destination, tag)

1) ``Prepare``  : Connection of MPI port included in the port_file (see below)
2) ``Run`` begin: Send at each beginning of the run (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 0)
3) ``Run`` end  : Receive at each ending of the run (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 0)
4) ``Run`` end  : Send shape of the data of the run (shape, 1,INT, 0, 0)
5) ``Run`` end  : Send data of the data of the run (data, shape, DOUBLE, 0, 0)
6) ``Run`` end  : Send at each ending of the run (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 1)
7) ``Cleanup``  : Send at this en of the simulation (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 2)

Data format
+++++++++++

The format of the data sent is an array consisting of (id device, id node, time
is ms).
