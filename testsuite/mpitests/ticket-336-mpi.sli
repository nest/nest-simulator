Name: testsuite::ticket-336-mpi - Check that vp-specific RNGs generate proper random numbers

Synopsis: (ticket-336-mpi) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
  This test ensures that GetVpRNG, when called on a node with proxies, generates
  the same random number is generated independent of the number of MPI
  processes.
  
Remarks: In response to the changes of GetStatus return values (cf #549),
  this test now only checks that the first 10 RNs from its VP-RNG are
  identical independent of the number of MPI processes.
