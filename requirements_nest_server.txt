# Required Python packages to run NEST Server.
#
# This file specifies the required Python packages to run NEST Server.
# It is meant for those who would like to compile NEST or build NEST 
# documentation themselves. If you just want to execute NEST, you should 
# install NEST directly as described in 
# https://www.nest-simulator.org/installation.
#
# The listed requirements are used to build the conda environment defined 
# in the environment yaml file. If you want to build an environment
# yourself, e.g., independent of conda, the requirements from this file
# can be installed by
#
#     pip install -r requirements_nest_server.txt
