Short description
+++++++++++++++++

Device for detecting binary states in neurons

Description
+++++++++++

The ``spin_detector`` is a recording device. It is used to decode and
record binary states from spiking activity from a single neuron, or
from multiple neurons at once. A single spike signals the 0 state, two
spikes at the same time signal the 1 state. If a neuron is in the 0 or
1 state and emits the spiking activity corresponding to the same
state, the same state is recorded again.  Therefore, it is not only
the transitions that are recorded. Data is recorded in memory or to
file as for all RecordingDevices. By default, node ID, time, and binary
state (0 or 1) for each decoded state is recorded. The state can be
accessed by calling ``detector.events["weight"]``.

The ``spin_detector`` will record binary state times with full
precision from neurons emitting precisely timed spikes.

Any node from which binary states are to be recorded, must be
connected to the ``spin_detector`` using the Connect command. Any
connection weight and delay will be ignored for that connection.

Simulations progress in cycles defined by the minimum delay. During
each cycle, the ``spin_detector`` records (stores in memory or writes to
screen/file) the states during the previous cycle. As a consequence,
any state information that was decoded during the cycle immediately
preceding the end of the simulation time will not be recorded. Setting
the /stop parameter to at the latest one ``min_delay`` period before the
end of the simulation time ensures that all binary states desired to
be recorded, are recorded.

States are not necessarily written to file in chronological order.
