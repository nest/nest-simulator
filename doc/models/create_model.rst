Create your own Model in NEST
================================


NEST is extensible and new models for neurons, synapses, and devices can be
added. If you would like to create your own model, check out the `NESTML Github
page <https://github.com/nest/nestml>`_. NESTML uses a Python based modeling language to make
it easier to create models in NEST. The project is still under development so
not all types of models have been implemented. You can find details about model
creation using our `C++ source code here <https://nest.github.io/nest-simulator/extension_modules>`_.
