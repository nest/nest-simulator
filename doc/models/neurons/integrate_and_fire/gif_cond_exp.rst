    gif_cond_exp - Conductance-based generalized integrate-and-fire neuron  
      model according to Mensi et al. (2012) and Pozzorini et al. (2015).

**Description:**
::

     
       
      gif_psc_exp is the generalized integrate-and-fire neuron according to  
      Mensi et al. (2012) and Pozzorini et al. (2015), with post-synaptic  
      conductances in the form of truncated exponentials.  
       
      This model features both an adaptation current and a dynamic threshold for  
      spike-frequency adaptation. The membrane potential (V) is described by the  
      differential equation:  
       
      C*dV(t)/dt = -g_L*(V(t)-E_L)    - eta_1(t)  - eta_2(t)  - ...   - eta_n(t) + I(t)  
       
      where each eta_i is a spike-triggered current (stc), and the neuron model can  
      have arbitrary number of them.  
      Dynamic of each eta_i is described by:  
       
      tau_eta_i*d{eta_i}/dt = -eta_i  
       
      and in case of spike emission, its value increased by a constant (which can be  
      positive or negative):  
       
      eta_i = eta_i + q_eta_i  (in case of spike emission).  
       
      Neuron produces spikes STOCHASTICALLY according to a point process with the  
      firing intensity:  
       
      lambda(t) = lambda_0 * exp[ (V(t)-V_T(t)) / Delta_V ]  
       
      where V_T(t) is a time-dependent firing threshold:  
       
      V_T(t) = V_T_star + gamma_1(t) + gamma_2(t) + ... + gamma_m(t)  
       
      where gamma_i is a kernel of spike-frequency adaptation (sfa), and the neuron  
      model can have arbitrary number of them.  
      Dynamic of each gamma_i is described by:  
       
      tau_gamma_i*d{gamma_i}/dt = -gamma_i  
       
      and in case of spike emission, its value increased by a constant (which can be  
      positive or negative):  
       
      gamma_i = gamma_i + q_gamma_i  (in case of spike emission).  
       
      Note that in the current implementation of the model (as described in [1] and  
      [2]) the values of eta_i and gamma_i are affected immediately after spike  
      emission. However, GIF toolbox (http://wiki.epfl.ch/giftoolbox) which fits  
      the model using experimental data, requires a different set of eta_i and  
      gamma_i. It applies the jump of eta_i and gamma_i after the refractory period.  
      One can easily convert between q_eta/gamma of these two approaches:  
      q_eta_giftoolbox = q_eta_NEST * (1 - exp( -tau_ref / tau_eta ))  
      The same formula applies for q_gamma.  
       
      The shape of synaptic conductance is exponential.
