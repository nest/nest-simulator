/**
 * Sparse representation of local nodes.
 *
 * SparseNodeArray maps node IDs of thread-local nodes to Node*. It provides
 * a const iterator interface for iteration over all local nodes, lookup by
 * node ID and lookup by numeric index into local nodes. The latter is provided
 * to support HPC synapses using TargetIdentifierIndex representation.
 *
 * For efficient lookup, all normal nodes (with proxies) need to be created together
 * and all devices need to be created together. It does not matter which are created first. If nodes
 * and devices are created alternatingly, lookup performance may suffer significantly
 * if many devices are present. This mainly affects network connection.
 *
 * As nodes are added to an initially empty SparseNodeArray, the array tracks
 * whether nodes have proxies or not. Array lookup is split at the point of the first
 * proxy/no-proxy (or no-proxy/proxy) transition between nodes. In the no-proxy
 * region, where all nodes are represented locally, Node IDs are mapped directly
 * to array indices. In the proxy region, they are scaled by 1/n_vp.
 *
 * To reliably reject requests for node IDs beyond the globally maximal node ID, the
 * latter must be set explicitly. A SparseNodeArray is said to be in *consistent state*
 * if the global maximal node ID has been set. Once add_local_node() is called, the
 * array is not in consistent state until the global maximal node ID is set again. This
 * is indicated by setting the max_node_id_ == 0. Looking up nodes while the
 * array is not in a consistent state triggers an assertion.
 *
 * To also support cases in which users alternate creation of nodes with and
 * without proxies or use nodes with special behavior (e.g., MUSIC nodes), we
 * perform a linear search from the estimated location of the node in the array.
 *
 * The following invariants hold when the array is in consistent state:
 *
 * 1. Entries are sorted by strictly increasing node ID (nid).
 * 2. All entries with index i < split_idx_ belong to the left part of the array,
 *    all remaining entries to the right part.
 * 3. All entries with node ID nid < split_node_id_ belong to the left part of the array,
 *    all remaining entries to the right part.
 * 4. nodes_[0].get_node()->has_proxies() == nodes_[i].get_node()->has_proxies() for 0 <= i < lookup_split_idx_
 *
 * @note
 * - The last invariant simply means that all nodes in the left part of the array have the same value of has_proxies().
 *
