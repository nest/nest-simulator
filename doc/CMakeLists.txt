  #    Sphinx can rewrite the source `pynestkernel.pyx` into a mocked `pynestkernel.py`
  # 3. Sphinx builds the documentation into the build directory, which then later gets
  #    installed into the target docdir.
  # 4. Sphinx generates the models RST documentation from the models/*.h files. But we
  #    need to copy them into a deeper directory.
  # 5. To make Python's `help` results more useful, `include` directives are inlined using
  #    `resolve_includes.py`
  # 6. This assembled Sphinx folder is marked to be installed, together with the logos.
