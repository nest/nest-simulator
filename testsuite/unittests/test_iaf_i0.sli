Name: testsuite::test_iaf_i0 - sli script for test of iaf_psc_alpha internal DC current

Synopsis: (test_iaf_i0) run -> compares response to internal dc with reference data


Description:

 test_iaf_i0.sli is a test of a specific feature of the iaf_psc_alpha
 model. It is tested whether an internal DC current that is present
 from the time of neuron initialization, correctly affects the membrane
 potential.

 This is probably the simplest setup in which we can study how the 
 dynamics develops from an initial condition.

 The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
 the script.

 When the DC current is supplied by a device external to the neuron
 the situation is more complex because additional delays are introduced.
