Name: testsuite::test_syn_hom_w - sli script for test synapse with homogeneous weight and delay.

Synopsis: (test_syn_hom_w) run -> compare response with reference data

Description:
Test of the overall function of static_synapse_hom_w.
A simple integrate-and-fire neuron is created. It is connected to a spike
generator and a voltmeter by static synapses with homogeneous weight.

FirstVersion: April 2008
