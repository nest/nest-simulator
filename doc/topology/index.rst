Topology
===========

The Topology Module is designed to build complex, layered networks in NEST.

* If you've never used topologically-structured networks before,  we recommend you
  check out the **PyNEST tutorial** :doc:`on Topologically-structured Networks <../tutorials/part-4-topologically-structured-networks>`

* We also recommend another **tutorial** :doc:`using the Hill Tononi model <../tutorials/topology/index>`

* For a **comprehensive guide** into topology, please see our `Topology User Manual <https://www.nest-simulator.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Topology_UserManual.pdf>`_
