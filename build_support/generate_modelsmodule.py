    This function applies a series of simple heuristics to find the

    expected to be in the form "#ifdef HAVE_<LIB>" with one guard per
    line. For the models, a list of unique pattern is used to infer
    the correct model type from the line in the file.

    The majority of neuron, device, and connection models are classes
    derived from a specific base class (like Node, ArchivingNode, or
    Connection) or from another model. The latter can only be detected
    if the base model has the same name as the file.

    The rate and binary neurons are typedefs for specialized template
    classes and multiple of such typedefs may be present in a file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_file: str
        The base file name (i.e. without extension) of the model file
        to get the information from.

    Returns
    -------

        0: HAVE_* preprocessor guards required for the models in the file
        1: a zip of model types and model names found in the file and
