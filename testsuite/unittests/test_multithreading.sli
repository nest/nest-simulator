Name: testsuite::test_multithreading - sli script for several tests regarding multithreading

Synopsis: (test_multithreading) run

Description:
This is a simple testscript to test if multithreading is working
correctly. The following things are tested:
  * Does setting the number of threads to x result in x threads?
  * Does ResetKernel reset the number of threads to 1?
  * Does default node distribution (modulo) work as expected?

The data collection over threads is tested in a separate script. See
SeeAlso key below.
