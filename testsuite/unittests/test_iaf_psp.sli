/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_iaf_psp - sli script for test of iaf_psc_alpha spike input

Synopsis: (test_iaf_psp) run -> compare response with reference data

Description:

 test_iaf_psp.sli checks the voltage response of the iaf_psc_alpha
 model neuron to a single incoming spike. The voltage excursion is
 called postsynaptic potential (PSP). In the iaf_psc_alpha model neuron
 the postsynaptic current is described by an alpha-function 
 (see [1] and references therein). The resulting PSP has a finite 
 rise-time, with voltage and current beeing zero in the initial 
 condition (see [1]).

 The dynamics is tested by connecting a device that emits spikes
 at individually configurable times (see test_spike_generator) to 
 a model neuron. 

 The weight of the connection specifies the peak value (amplitude)
 of the postsynaptic current (PSC) in pA.

 The subthreshold dynamics of the iaf_psc_alpha is integrated exactly.
 Therefore, it is suitable to check whether the simulation kernel 
 produces results independent of the computation step size
 (resolution).

 In order to obtain identical results for different computation
 step sizes h, the SLI script needs to be independent of h.
 This is achieved by specifying all time parameters in milliseconds
 (ms). In particular the time of spike emission and the synaptic
 delay need to be integer multiples of the computation step sizes 
 to be tested. test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay demonstrates the strategy
 for the case of DC current input.

 The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of
 the script.
