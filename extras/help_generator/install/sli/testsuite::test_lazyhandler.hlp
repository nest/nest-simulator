Name: testsuite::test_lazyhandler - test if SLI returns exit code 0 when an error is handled by a lazy user error handler.

Synopsis:

(test_lazyhandler) run ->


Description:

This script establishes a user error handler and then provokes an 
error. The error handler does NOT reset errodict::newerror to false. 
This is wrong behaviour, but it is no error that normally prevents 
execution of the script. Although this is strictly speaking a 
programming error, NEST should pass this scipt and return exit code 0.
