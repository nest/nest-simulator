CMake Options for NEST
======================

NEST is installed with ``cmake`` (at least v3.12). In the simplest case, the commands::

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<nest_install_dir> <nest_source_dir>
    make
    make install

should build and install NEST to ``/install/path``, which should be an absolute
path.


Choice of compiler
------------------

We :doc:`systematically test <../contribute/ci>` NEST using the GNU gcc and the Clang compiler suites.
Compilation with other up-to-date compilers should also work, but we do not
regularly test against those compilers and can thus only provide limited support.

To select a specific compiler, please add the following flags to your ``cmake``
line::

    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C-compiler> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++-compiler>

Options for configuring NEST
----------------------------

NEST allows for several configuration options for custom builds:

Change NEST behavior::

    -Dtics_per_ms=[number]     Specify elementary unit of time. [default 1000.0]
    -Dtics_per_step=[number]   Specify resolution. [default 100]

Add user modules::

    -Dexternal-modules=[OFF|<list;of;modules>]  External NEST modules to be linked
                                                in, separated by ';'. [default=OFF]

Connect NEST with external projects::

    -Dwith-music=[OFF|ON|</path/to/music>] Request the use of MUSIC. Optionally
                                           give the directory, where MUSIC is installed.
                                           [default=OFF]

Change parallelization scheme::

    -Dwith-mpi=[OFF|ON|</path/to/mpi>]  Request compilation with MPI. Optionally
                                        give directory with MPI installation.
                                        [default=OFF]
    -Dwith-openmp=[OFF|ON|<OpenMP-Flag>]  Enable OpenMP multi-threading.
                                          Optional: set OMP flag. [default=ON]

Set default libraries::

    -Dwith-gsl=[OFF|ON|</path/to/gsl>]           Find a gsl library. To set a specific
                                                 library, set install path.[default=ON]
    -Dwith-readline=[OFF|ON|</path/to/readline>] Find a GNU Readline library. To set
                                                 a specific library, set install path.
                                                 [default=ON]
    -Dwith-ltdl=[OFF|ON|</path/to/ltdl>]         Find an ltdl library. To set a specific
                                                 ltdl, set install path. NEST uses the
                                                 ltdl for dynamic loading of external
                                                 user modules. [default=ON]
    -Dwith-python=[OFF|ON]                       Build PyNEST. [default=ON]
    -Dcythonize-pynest=[OFF|ON]                  Use Cython to cythonize pynestkernel.pyx.
                                                 If OFF, PyNEST has to be build from
                                                 a pre-cythonized pynestkernel.pyx.
                                                 [default=ON]

    -Dwith-warning=[OFF|ON|<list;of;flags>]        Enable user defined warnings. Separate
                                                   multiple flags by ';'.
                                                   [default ON, when ON, defaults to '-Wall']
    -Dwith-debug=[OFF|ON|<list;of;flags>]          Enable user defined debug flags. Separate
                                                   multiple flags by ';'.
                                                   [default OFF, when ON, defaults to '-g']
    -Dwith-intel-compiler-flags=[<list;of;flags>]  User defined flags for the Intel compiler.
                                                   Separate multiple flags by ';'.

    -Dwith-libraries=<list;of;libraries>           Link additional libraries. Give full path.
                                                   Separate multiple libraries by ';'.
                                                   [default OFF]

                                                   Separate multiple defines by ';'. [default OFF]


.. _compile-with-mpi:

Configuring NEST for Distributed Simulation with MPI
----------------------------------------------------

NEST supports distributed simulations using the Message Passing
Interface (MPI). Depending on your setup, you have to use one of the
following steps in order to add support for MPI:

  1. Try ``-Dwith-mpi=ON`` as argument for ``cmake``.
  2. If 1. does not work, or you want to use a non-standard MPI, try
     ``-Dwith-mpi=/path/to/my/mpi``. The `mpi` directory should
     contain the `include`, `lib` and `bin` subdirectories of the MPI
     installation.
  3. If 2. does not work, but you know the correct compiler wrapper
     for your installation, try adding the following to the invocation
     of ``cmake``::
         -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=myC++_CompilerWrapper
         -DMPI_C_COMPILER=myC_CompilerWrapper -Dwith-mpi=ON

When running large-scale parallel simualations and recording from many
neurons, writing to ASCII files might become prohibitively slow due to
the large number of resulting files. By installing the `SIONlib
library <http://www.fz-juelich.de/jsc/sionlib>`_ and supplying its
installation path to the ``-Dwith-sionlib=<path>`` option when calling
`cmake`, you can enable the :ref:`recording backend for binary files
<recording_backend_sionlib>`, which solves this problem.

If you compiled NEST with support for MPI and also want to run the
corresponding tests, you have to tell it about how your
``mpirun``/``mpiexec`` command works by defining the ``mpirun``
function in your ``~/.nestrc`` file. The file already contains an
example implementation that should work with the `OpenMPI
<http://www.openmpi.org>`__ implementation. For more details, see the
documentation on the :doc:`configuration`.

See the :doc:`../guides/parallel_computing` to learn how to execute
threaded and distributed simulations with NEST.

.. _compile_with_libneurosim:

Support for libneurosim
-----------------------

In order to allow NEST to create connections using external libraries,
it provides support for the Connection Generator Interface from
*libneurosim*. To request the use of libneurosim, you have to use the
follwing switch for the invocation of ``cmake``. It expects either
*ON* or *OFF*, or the directory where libneurosim is installed::

    -Dwith-libneurosim=[OFF|ON|</path/to/libneurosim>]

For details on how to use the Connection Generator Interface, see the
:ref:`guide on connection management <conn_builder_conngen>`.

Disabling the Python Bindings (PyNEST)
--------------------------------------

To disable Python bindings use::

    -Dwith-python=OFF

as an argument to ``cmake``.

Please see the :doc:`README <pynest_readme_link>` for details.

Python Binding (PyNEST)
-----------------------

Note that since NEST 3.0, support for Python 2 has been dropped. Please use Python 3 instead.

``cmake`` usually autodetects your Python installation.
In some cases ``cmake`` might not be able to localize the Python interpreter
and its corresponding libraries correctly. To circumvent such a problem following
``cmake`` built-in variables can be set manually and passed to ``cmake``::

  PYTHON_EXECUTABLE ..... path to the Python interpreter
  PYTHON_LIBRARY ........ path to libpython
  PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR .... two include ...
  PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR2 ... directories

 e.g.: Please note ``-Dwith-python=ON`` is the default::
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<nest_install_dir> \
        -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 \
        -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.4m.so \
        -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.4 \
        -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR2=/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/python3.4m \
        <nest_source_dir>



Compiler-specific options
-------------------------

NEST has reasonable default compiler options for the most common compilers.

Intel compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that computations obey the IEEE754 standard for floating point
numerics, the ``-fp-model strict`` flag is used by default, but can be
overridden with ::

      -Dwith-intel-compiler-flags="<intel-flags>"

Portland compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``-Kieee`` flag to ensure that computations obey the IEEE754 standard for floating point numerics.
