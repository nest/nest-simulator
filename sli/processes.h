/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: fork - create a child process of SLI

Synopsis: fork -> PID

Description: Thin wrapper to the fork() system function

Parameters: In : -none-
            Out: PID(integer) : 0 (for the child)
                                the child's process ID (for the parent)

Examples: 1. fork
             (Well, just kidding...)

          2. fork 0 eq {(I'm the child!) = quit} {(I'm the parent!) =} ifelse
             Try this several times. You will notice the child message to appear
             before or after the parent message "by chance". (Even after the
             parent's SLI-prompt...)

Bugs: -

Author: R Kupper

FirstVersion: Mar 17 1999

Remarks: A full parallel process of SLI is forked.
         Parent and child will execute in parallel. There is no way to know
         which will start being executed first.
         Child inherits all open files, including stdin and stdout, from parent!
         Thus, calling fork interactively from the SLI-prompt will result in
         command-line-confusion if both processes end up without quitting.
         If fork() cannot be executed, an error is raised.

         SLI-function spoon (processes.sli) is a more convenient wrapper
          to fork!

/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: waitPID - wait or check for a child process to terminate

Synopsis: PIDin NoHangFlag waitPID -> Status NormalExitFlag PIDout
                                   -> 0

Description: The waitPID function suspends execution of the calling process
              until status information for the given child is available,
              or until delivery of a signal whose action is either to
              execute a signal-catching function or to terminate the
              process. If status information is available prior to the call
              to waitPID, it returns immediately.

              The waitPID function returns the process ID of the child for
              which status is being reported.
              Zero is returned immediately, if the NoHangFlag is set
              and no status is available.

              Alternatives: Function waitPID_i_b (undocumented)
              -> behaviour and synopsis are the same.

Parameters: In : PIDin(integer):      -1: Wait for any child process.
                                positive: Wait for the specific child whose
                                          process ID is equal to PIDin.
                           (           0: -not supported-)
                           (less than -1: -not supported-)

                 NoHangFlag(boolean):
                  If true, causes waitPID function not to suspend execution
                  of the calling process if status is not immediately
                  available for any of the child processes specified by
                  PIDin. In this case, zero is returned as only result.

            Out: PIDout(integer):
                   The process ID of the child for which status is being
                   reported.

                 NormalExitFlag(boolean):
                   True, if status is returned for a child that terminated
                   normally, i.e. by a call to exit() or by returning from
                   main(). In that case, the exit code is reported in the Status
                   argument (see below).
                   False, if status is returned for a child that terminated due
                   to a signal that was not caught. In that case, the number of
                   that signal is reported in the Status argument (see below).

                 Status(integer):
                   If NormalExitFlag is true, this reports the child's exit
                   code, i.e. the low-order eight bits of the status argument
                   that the child passed to exit(), or the value the child
                   process returned from main().
                   If NormalExitFlag is false, this reports the number of the
                   signal that caused the termination of the child process. Look
                   up this number in signaldict, to know what it means.

Examples:1. {(sleep 3) sysexec} spoon false waitPID
         2. {(ls) sysexec} spoon false waitPID
            Note the parent process' SLI-Prompt appearing AFTER execution of the
            command finished.
            This is different to the call "{(ls) sysexec} spoon" only.
         3. 23 false waitPID

Remarks: The features normally used only by the UNIX-shell-program
          (such as the WUNTRACED-option) are currently not supported,
          although values <=0 can be passed through PIDin.

/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: kill - send a signal to another process

Synopsis: PID  SIGNAL kill -> -
          PID /SIGNAL kill -> -

Description: The "kill" function sends a signal to a process or a group
              of processes specified by "PID". If the signal is zero,
              error checking is performed but no signal is actually sent.
              This can be used to check for a valid PID.
             SIGNAL may be given either as an integer value or as the
              literal name of the signal, as found in "signaldict".

              Alternative: Functions kill_i_i for integer (SIGNAL),
              kill_i_l for literal (SIGNAL) (both undocumented)
              -> behaviour and synopsis are the same.

Parameters: In : PID(integer):
                   The ID of the process that shall be signalled.
                   If "PID" is greater than zero, "SIGNAL" is sent to the
                    process whose ID is "PID".
                   (If "PID" is negative, "SIGNAL" is sent to all processes
                    whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value
                    of "PID". - Process groups are usually used by the
                    shell program only.)

                 SIGNAL(integer):
                   The number of the signal to be sent.
                   Signal codes are machine-dependent values, so do not
                    rely on any given value! The valid signal codes for
                    your machine are compiled into the "signaldict"
                    dictionary, where they can be looked up by
                    their literal names.
                   The only value you may rely on is zero:
                    If SIGNAL is zero, error checking is performed
                    but no signal is actually sent.
                    This can be used to check for a valid PID.

                  /SIGNAL(literal):
                   The literal name of the signal to be sent.
                   This name is automatically looked up in "signaldict"
                    and substituted to it's corresponding value prior
                    to a call to wait.

            Out: -none-.

Examples: 1. 23 /SIGTERM kill %send TERM signal to Process 23

          2. %This is equivalent to 1. :
             signaldict begin
             23 SIGTERM kill
             end

          3. (xterm) 2 system %star an xterm-process
             /SIGKILL kill    %kill it again

Author: R Kupper

FirstVersion: Apr 27 1999

Remarks: "kill" can be used to send ANY signal, but it's most oftenly used
          to terminate another process. Hence the name.
         Resolution of literal signal names is done by a trie defined
          in file processes.sli.

              Data can be written to "write_end" and read from "read_end".
             A read on "read_end" accesses the data written to "write_end"
             on a first-in-first-out basis.

Parameters: In : -none-

            Out: read_end(ifstream):
                   A filestream open for reading, connected to the read-
                   end of the newly created pipe.

                 write_end(ofstream):
                   A filestream open for writing, connected to the write-
                   end of the newly created pipe.

Examples: pipe
          (Hello Pipe) <- std::endl
          pop
          getline =

Diagnostics: If a system-error occurs, a code is stored in "sys_errno"
              (contained in errordict) to identify the error, and
              "sys_errname" is set to the error message. Then a
              "SystemError" is raised.

Remarks:  Description-text taken mainly from "POSIX Programmer's Guide",
         D. Lewine, O'Reilly & Assoc. Inc.

          The O_NONBLOCK and FD_CLOEXEC flags are clear on the
         file descriptors of both streams.

          Opening a pipe in a single process is next to useless (however,
         it might be used for buffering data). The usual application
         is for inter-process-communication: A pipe is opened, and fork
         is called. The child process inherits both filestreams from
         the parent. The child will then close one of the streams (say:
         the read-end), the parent will close the other (say: the write-
         end). Data may then be transfered from the child to the parent
         process through the pipe.

          If the child is to "sysexec" a UNIX command, it may duplicate
         the pipes's write-end onto its standard "cout" stream using "dup2",
         thus directing any data written to "cout" into the pipe. It then
         calles "sysexec". The parent process is thus enabled to read
         the UNIX-command's standard output from the pipe.

          Pipes are unidirectional communication channels.
         For bidirectional communication, two separate pipes must be opened.
         The "spawn" command provides this functionality.

/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: available - check if data is available from an istream

Synopsis: istream available -> istream {true|false}

Description: "available" gives the answer to one question:
             --Is there at least one character waiting to be read
               from the istream?--
             If "available" returns true, it can be safely assumed that
             reading one character from the given istream is safe,
             i.e. it will NEITHER BLOCK nor yield EOF or an error.

             Alternative: Functions available_is (undocumented)
             -> behavior and synopsis are the same.

Parameters: In:  istream: The istream to check.
            Out: true or false, indicating if data is waiting on the stream.

Examples: myfifo available { getline } if % read it data is available.

Diagnostics: If a system-error occurs, a code is stored in "sys_errno"
             (contained in errordict) to identify the error, and "sys_errname"
             is set to the error message. Then a "SystemError" is raised.
             The following system errors may be issued, according to the
             POSIX standard (errors in parentheses are not
             expected to occur in this routines' context):

             (EACCES)  Search permission is denied for a
                       directory in a files path prefix.
             (EAGAIN)  The ON_NONBLOCK flag is set for a file
                       descriptor and the process would be
                       delayed in the I/O operation.
              EBADF    Invalid file descriptor. (With the current
                       implementation, this indicates trouble
                       getting a fildescriptor from a stream. If
                       it occurs, ask the author for a proper
                       solution!)
             (EDEADLK) A fcntl with function F_SETLKW would
                       cause a deadlock.
              EINTR    Function was interrupted by a signal.
             (EINVAL)  Invalid argument.
             (EMFILE   Too many file descriptors are in use by
                       this process.
             (ENOLCK)  No locks available.

Remarks: "available" will be typically used with pipes or fifos.

         There are two possible reasons why "available" may return false:
          1. There are processes writing to the pipe/fifo, but none
             of the is currently writing data to it.
              A subsequent read attempt will block until data becomes
             available.
          2. There are no processes writing to the pipe (any longer).
              A subsequent read attempt will yield EOF.
         It is NOT possible to tell these possibilities apart! This is
         not a fault of the implementation of this function. It is generally
         impossible to do this. The only way to know is to start a read
         attempt. If it blocks, you know the answer - but you could wait
         forever. Anyway, there normally is no need to distinguish between
         these alternatives: Just NEVER try a read attempt, if "available"
         returned false. Even if temporarily no process was connected to
         the stream, it will return true as soon as the connection is re-
         established and data is waiting.

         "available" just tells you if -one- character may be read safely.
          It is left to the programmer to assure that a given amount of
         data (e.g. upto the next linefeed) may be read.

/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: mkfifo - Create a FIFO special file (named pipe)

Synopsis: path mkfifo -> -

Description: The "mkfifo" command creates a new FIFO special file named
             "path". The permission bits are set to "rwx rwx rwx" (full access
             for anyone). Note that these bits may be modified by the process'

Remarks: The FIFO may be used (and has to be opened) like any regular file.

         In special cases, it might be desireable to change the FIFO's file
         permission bits. This is not supported by SLI commands.
         Use UNIX-command "chmod" to change file permissions on the newly
         created file, or use UNIX-command "umask" to set the process' file
         creation mask. (See command "system" for issuing UNIX-commands from
         SLI).

/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: setNONBLOCK - Switch between blocking and non-blocking I/O.

Synopsis: ifstream {true|false} setNONBLOCK -> ifstream

Description: "setNONBLOCK" sets or erases the O_NONBLOCK flag on
             an input stream. The O_NONBLOCK flag determines, if
             a read attempt will block when no data is currently
             available from the stream. By default, a newly
             created stream has the O_NONBLOCK-Flag erased,
             meaning that blocking I/O is selected. By erasing
             O_NONBLOCK, a subsequent read attempt on the stream
             will yield EOF if no data is available.

             Alternatives: Function setNONBLOCK_is_b (undocumented)
             -> behavior and synopsis are the same.

Parameters: In : ifstream: The stream to change the flag on.
