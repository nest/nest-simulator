\class lockPTR

 This template is the standard safe-pointer implementation
 of NEST.

 In order for this scheme to work smoothly, the user has to take some
 precautions:
 1. each pointer should only be used ONCE to initialize a lockPTR.
 2. The lockPTR assumes that there are no other access points to the
    protected pointer.
 3. The lockPTR can freely be copied and passed between objects and functions.
 4. lockPTR objects should be used like the pointer to the object.
 5. lockPTR objects should be passed as objects in function calls and
    function return values.
 6. There should be no pointers to lockPTR objects.

 Class lockPTR is designed to behave just like the pointer would.  You
 can use the dereference operators (* and ->) to access the protected
 object. However, the pointer itself is (with exceptions) never
 exposed to the user.

 Since all access to the referenced object is done via a lockPTR, it
 is possible to maintain a count of all active references. If this
 count drops to zero, the referenced object can safely be destroyed.
 For dynamically allocated objects, delete is invoked on the stored
 pointer.

 class lockPTR distinguishes between dynamically and automatically
 allocated objects by the way it is initialised:

 If a lockPTR is initialised with a pointer, it assumes that the
 referenced object was dynamically allocated and will call the
 destructor once the reference count drops to zero.

 If the lockPTR is initialised with a reference, it assumes that the
 object is automatically allocated. Thus, the lockPTR will NOT call the
 destructor.

 In some cases it is necessary for a routine to actually get hold of
 the pointer, contained in the lockPTR object.  This can be done by
 using the member function get().  After the pointer has been exposed
 this way, the lockPTR will regard the referenced object as unsafe,
 since the user might call delete on the pointer. Thus, lockPTR will
 "lock" the referenced object and deny all further access.
 The object can be unlocked by calling the unlock() member.

 Equality for lockPTRs is defined as identity of the data object.
