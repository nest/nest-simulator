   Benchmark 3 of the simulator review

   The SLI code in this file creates a sparsely coupled network of
   excitatory and inhibitory neurons which exhibits self-sustained
   activity after an initial stimulus.  Connections within and across
   both populations are created at random.  Both neuron populations
   receive Poissonian background input.  The spike output of 500
   neurons from each population are recorded.  Neurons are modeled
   as Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with conductance based synapses
   (exponential functions).  The model is based on
