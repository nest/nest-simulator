/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_multithreading_devices - sli script to test data collection across threads

Synopsis: (test_multithreading_devices) run

Description:
This script tests, if data collection across threads is working
correctly. In particular, the test checks if the events dictionary
is the same if we run with one or two threads.
