**Name:**
::

    erfc_neuron - Binary stochastic neuron with complementary error
      function as activation function.

**Description:**
::


      The erfc_neuron is an implementation of a binary neuron that
      is irregularly updated at Poisson time points. At each update
      point the total synaptic input h into the neuron is summed up,
      passed through a gain function g whose output is interpreted as
      the probability of the neuron to be in the active (1) state.

      The gain function g used here is

      g(h) = 0.5 * erfc (( h - theta_ ) / ( sqrt( 2. ) * sigma)).

      This corresponds to a McCulloch-Pitts neuron receiving additional
      Gaussian noise with mean 0 and standard deviation sigma.
      The time constant tau_m is defined as the mean of the
      inter-update-interval that is drawn from an exponential
      distribution with this parameter. Using this neuron to reproduce
      simulations with asynchronous update (similar to [1,2]), the time
      constant needs to be chosen as tau_m = dt*N, where dt is the simulation time
      step and N the number of neurons in the original simulation with
      asynchronous update. This ensures that a neuron is updated on
      average every tau_m ms. Since in the original papers [1,2] neurons
      are coupled with zero delay, this implementation follows that
      definition. It uses the update scheme described in [3] to
      maintain causality: The incoming events in time step t_i are
      taken into account at the beginning of the time step to calculate
      the gain function and to decide upon a transition.  In order to
      obtain delayed coupling with delay d, the user has to specify the
      delay d+h upon connection, where h is the simulation time step.



**Parameters:**
::


      tau_m   double - Membrane time constant (mean inter-update-interval) (ms)
      theta     double - threshold for sigmoidal activation function (mV)
      sigma     double - 1/sqrt(2pi) x inverse of maximal slope (mV)



**Receives:**
::

    SpikeEvent, PotentialRequest


**Sends:**
::

    SpikeEvent


**Remarks:**
::


      This neuron has a special use for spike events to convey the
      binary state of the neuron to the target. The neuron model
      only sends a spike if a transition of its state occurs. If the
      state makes an up-transition it sends a spike with multiplicity 2,
      if a down transition occurs, it sends a spike with multiplicity 1.
      The decoding scheme relies on the feature that spikes with multiplicity
      larger 1 are delivered consecutively, also in a parallel setting.
      The creation of double connections between binary neurons will
      destroy the decoding scheme, as this effectively duplicates
      every event. Using random connection routines it is therefore
      advisable to set the property 'multapses' to false.
      The neuron accepts several sources of currents, e.g. from a
      noise_generator.
