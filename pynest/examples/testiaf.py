IAF neuron example with current generator
-----------------------------------------

A DC current is injected into the neuron using a current generator
device. The membrane potential as well as the spiking activity are
recorded by corresponding devices.

It can be observed how the current charges the membrane, a spike
is emitted, the neuron becomes absolute refractory, and finally
starts to recover.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Second the function ``build_network`` is defined to build the network and
# return the handles of the ``spike_recorder`` and the ``voltmeter``. The
# function takes the simulation resolution as argument
#
# The function first resets the simulation kernel and sets the number of
# threads and the simulation resolution.  The ``iaf_psc_alpha`` neuron is
# created and the handle is stored in the variable `neuron`. The status of
# the neuron is changed so it receives an external current. Next a
# ``voltmeter`` and a ``spike_recorder`` are created and their handles stored
# in the variables `vm` and `sr` respectively.
#
# The voltmeter and spike recorder are then connected to the neuron. ``Connect``
# takes the device and neuron handles as input. The voltmeter is connected to the
# neuron and the neuron to the spike recorder because the neuron sends spikes
# to the recorder and the voltmeter 'observes' the neuron.

# end of the simulation period.
