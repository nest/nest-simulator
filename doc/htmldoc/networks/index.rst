Network Models
==============

Here we have several examples of large-scale network models developed for NEST.

You can see how to build other networks for various neuron, synapse and device types in our
:doc:`examples gallery </examples/index>`.

We have a detailed guide on :ref:`spatially-structured networks <spatial_networks>` as well.
