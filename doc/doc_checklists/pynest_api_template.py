def function.name(x=default, y=None):
    """Connect pre nodes to post nodes

    Nodes in pre and post are connected using the specified connectivity
    (all-to-all by default) and synapse type (static_synapse by default).
    Details depend on the connectivity rule (see Notes).

    .. deprecated:: 1.6.0

            `ndobj_old` will be removed in NumPy 2.0.0, it is replaced by
            `ndobj_new` because the latter works also with array subclasses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : type
        Description of parameter `x`.
    y
         Description of parameter `y` (with type not specified)

    Returns
    --------
    err_code : int
        Non-zero value indicates error code, or zero on success.

    int
         Description of anonymous integer return value.

    Raises
    -------
     kernel.NESTError
         If the matrix is not numerically invertible.

    Notes
    -------

    Details on the connectivity. This section may include
    mathematical equations:
    The discrete-time Fourier time-convolution  [1]_ property states that

    .. math::

         x(n) * y(n) \Leftrightarrow X(e^{j\omega } )Y(e^{j\omega } )


    The value of :math:`\omega` is larger than 5.


    * use the asterisk for bullet items
    * second item
