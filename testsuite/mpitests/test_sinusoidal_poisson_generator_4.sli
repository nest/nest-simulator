 /** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_poisson_generator_4 - Test parallel generation of sinusoidally modulate Poissonian trains with individual spike trains

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_sinusoidal_poisson_generator_4.sli -> -

Description:
   Creates a sinusoidally modulated Poisson generator emitting
   individual spike trains to each of its targets and sends spikes to
   spike recorder. Identical to ..._2, but with single generator, not one per VP.

Author:  December 2012, May 2013, Plesser, based on test_poisson_generator.sli
