    Name: testsuite::test_gap_junction - Ensure that gap_junction connection can only be created between neurons which support them.

    Synopsis: (test_gap_junction) run -> NEST exits if test fails

    Description:
    Ensure that NEST throws an exception if one tries to create illegal gap-junction connections. 
    Furthermore it is checked that the delay cannot be set for gap-junction connections.
