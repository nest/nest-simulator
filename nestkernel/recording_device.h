Recording time window
+++++++++++++++++++++

The time span during which the recorder actively records can be
specified using the properties ``start`` and ``stop``. These define
the recording period of the device in ms. An additional property
``origin`` allows to shift the recording window by a certain time,
which can be useful in experimental protocols with :ref:`repeated
simulations <stepped_simulations>`. Please note that events with
timestamp `t = start` are not recorded.

Data handling
+++++++++++++

All recorded data is handed over to the recording backend, selected
via the ``record_to`` property. More details on available backends and
their properties can be found in the :ref:`guide to recording from
simulations <recording_backends>`.

Recorder properties
+++++++++++++++++++

label
    A string (default: `""`) specifying an arbitrary textual label for
    the device.  Recording backends might use the label to generate
    device specific identifiers like filenames and such.

n_events
    The number of events that were collected by the recorder can be
    read out of the `n_events` entry. The number of events can be reset
    to 0. Other values cannot be set.

origin
    A positive floating point number (default : `0.0`) used as the
    reference time in ms for `start` and `stop`.

record_to
    A string (default: `"memory"`) containing the name of the recording
    backend where to write data to. An empty string turns all recording
    of individual events off.

start
    A positive floating point number (default: `0.0`) specifying the
    activation time in ms, relative to `origin`.

stop
    A floating point number (default: `infinity`) specifying the
    deactivation time in ms, relative to `origin`. The value of `stop`
    must be greater than or equal to `start`.

/**
 * Base class for all recording devices.
 *
 * Recording devices collect or sample data and output it to one or
 * more recording backends selected by setting the device property
 * `record_to` to the name of the backend.
 *
 * Class RecordingDevice is merely a shallow interface class from
 * which concrete recording devices can inherit in order to use the
 * recording backend infrastructure more easily and provide a
 * consistent handling of activity windows by means of start/stop and
 * origin.
 *
 * If the device is configured to record from start to stop, this
 * is interpreted as (start, stop], i.e., the earliest recorded
 * event will have time stamp start+1, as it was generated during
 * the update step (start, start+1].
 *
 * If the device node is not an actual instance used by the user, but
 * rather a prototype node in a Model class, it will cache
 * device-specific properties of the recording backend and use them
 * for enrollment of the device with the backend as the last step
 * during the creation of instances. This mechanism is implemented in
 * set_status() and set_initialized_().
