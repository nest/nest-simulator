# Conda environment specification for NEST Simulator.
#
# This file specifies a conda environment for those who would
# like to compile NEST or build NEST documentation themselves.
# If you just want to execute NEST, you should install NEST
# directly as described in https://www.nest-simulator.org/installation.
#
# The environment specification below is comprehensive: it includes
# all packages required to build and run NEST with OpenMP and MPI
# parallelization, GSL-dependent models, NumPy and Pandas-dependent
# features of PyNEST and examples requiring Matplotlib, and to run
# the NEST testsuite. It also comprises all tools required to build
# NEST documentation and to run NEST Server. The required Python
# packages are divided in separate requirements files and marked in
# separate sections below so you can remove them if you would like a
# leaner environment.
#
# NOTE: libneurosim, MUSIC and SIONLib are not included in this environment.
#
# To create an environment from this file, run
#
#     conda env create --name <my_env_name> --file environment.yml
#
# where <my_env_name> is a name of your choice.

  # mpi4py must be installed by conda in order to automatically find the path
  # to OpenMPI installed by conda. Note that mpi4py also is included in
  # requirements_pynest.txt in case someone wants to build an environment
  # without conda. When this conda environment is built, the pip installation
  # of mpi4py will be skipped since it is already installed by conda.
