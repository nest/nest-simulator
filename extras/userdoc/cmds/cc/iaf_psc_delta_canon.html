<b>Name:</b><pre>iaf_psc_delta_canon - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model.</pre>
<b>Description: </b>
<pre> <br/>     iaf_psc_delta_canon is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model  <br/>     where the potential jumps on each spike arrival.  <br/>   <br/>     The threshold crossing is followed by an absolute refractory period  <br/>     during which the membrane potential is clamped to the resting  <br/>     potential.  <br/>   <br/>     Spikes arriving while the neuron is refractory, are discarded by  <br/>     default. If the property "refractory_input" is set to true, such  <br/>     spikes are added to the membrane potential at the end of the  <br/>     refractory period, dampened according to the interval between  <br/>     arrival and end of refractoriness.  <br/>   <br/>     The linear subthresold dynamics is integrated by the Exact  <br/>     Integration scheme [1]. The neuron dynamics are solved exactly in  <br/>     time. Incoming and outgoing spike times are handled precisely [3].  <br/>   <br/>     An additional state variable and the corresponding differential  <br/>     equation represents a piecewise constant external current.  <br/>   <br/>     Spikes can occur either on receipt of an excitatory input spike, or  <br/>     be caused by a depolarizing input current.  Spikes evoked by  <br/>     incoming spikes, will occur precisely at the time of spike arrival,  <br/>     since incoming spikes are modeled as instantaneous potential  <br/>     jumps. Times of spikes caused by current input are determined  <br/>     exactly by solving the membrane potential equation. Note that, in  <br/>     contrast to the neuron models discussed in [3,4], this model has so  <br/>     simple dynamics that no interpolation or iterative spike location  <br/>     technique is required at all.  <br/>   <br/>     The general framework for the consistent formulation of systems with  <br/>     neuron like dynamics interacting by point events is described in  <br/>     [1].  A flow chart can be found in [2].  <br/>   <br/>     Critical tests for the formulation of the neuron model are the  <br/>     comparisons of simulation results for different computation step  <br/>     sizes. sli/testsuite/nest contains a number of such tests.  <br/>   <br/>     The iaf_psc_delta_canon is the standard model used to check the consistency  <br/>     of the nest simulation kernel because it is at the same time complex  <br/>     enough to exhibit non-trivial dynamics and simple enough compute  <br/>     relevant measures analytically.  <br/>   <br/>

<b>Remarks: </b>
<pre> <br/>   <br/>     The iaf_psc_delta_canon neuron accepts CurrentEvent connections.  <br/>     However, the present method for transmitting CurrentEvents in  <br/>     NEST (sending the current to be applied) is not compatible with off-grid  <br/>     currents, if more than one CurrentEvent-connection exists. Once CurrentEvents  <br/>     are changed to transmit change-of-current-strength, this problem will  <br/>     disappear and the canonical neuron will also be able to handle CurrentEvents.  <br/>   <br/>     The present implementation uses individual variables for the  <br/>     components of the state vector and the non-zero matrix elements of  <br/>     the propagator.  Because the propagator is a lower triangular matrix  <br/>     no full matrix multiplication needs to be carried out and the  <br/>     computation can be done "in place" i.e. no temporary state vector  <br/>     object is required.  <br/>   <br/>     The template support of recent C++ compilers enables a more succinct  <br/>     formulation without loss of runtime performance already at minimal  <br/>     optimization levels. A future version of iaf_psc_delta_canon will probably  <br/>     address the problem of efficient usage of appropriate vector and  <br/>     matrix objects.  <br/>   <br/>     Please note that this node is capable of sending precise spike times  <br/>     to target nodes (on-grid spike time plus offset). If this node is  <br/>     connected to a spike_detector, the property "precise_times" of the  <br/>     spike_detector has to be set to true in order to record the offsets  <br/>     in addition to the on-grid spike times.  <br/>   <br/>
