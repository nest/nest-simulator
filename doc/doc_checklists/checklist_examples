Checklist Examples
===================

- Docstring (NumPy Style)

  	[] Use triple double quotes """ to demarcate docstring from rest of file
    [] First heading underlined with --- (Ensure the dashes extend beyond text)
    [] Subheadings underlined with ~~~
    [] Headings, reST directives should be separated from other text by new line
    [] The order of sections in the docstring: Summary line, extended summary
       (no heading), See Also, Notes (optional), References, author, KEYWORDS)
    [] Summary line; title that briefly describes example, on same line as """
    [] Summary line is underlined with dashes extending beyond the text.
    [] **Only one** docstring allowed in example script (see section additional
       comments, for including comments within code)
    [] Variables, functions and objects should be surrounded by single
       back ticks (e.g. `var`). In text, paths and values should be surrounded
       by double back ticks (e.g. ``/path/to/file/`` and ``x = 0``)

- Extended Summary Section and Notes section

   [] Below summary line, there should be an extended summary section that
      describes the purpose of example and the models used within. A brief
      desription of the steps involved in plain English should be included.
   [] Background theory or mathematical equations should be included in the Notes
      section, but this is optional.

- Bibliography Format

    [] In-text citations are formatted with reST format [1]_ (Note underscore).
    [] A section called References must be included if citation given.

    [] Surname first for all authors, if more than 3 authors, use 'et al.'.
    [] Article title in sentence case, full name of journal in title case
    [] Year should follows authors
    [] Include DOI, if available

- Math Format

    [] Model equations should not be included in the examples. But if some form
       of math is required, only include them in the Notes section.
    [] Equation in LaTeX format using reST math directive or math role

- See Also section

     [] The last section should be the See Also section that includes filenames
        of 2 or 3 related examples or other related docs.

- author

   [] Author(s) who contributed example is included
   [] First name initials followed by last name

- Keywords

    [] The last item in docstring is KEYWORDS (written in allcaps with colon)
    [] Keywords are comma separated

       include important terms.

- Additional comments

   [] Comments in code block must be preceded by #
   [] If comment is longer than one line then the comment must be preceded by a
      line of hashes (80 char length)

- Code

   [] Code is complete, such that the script can be executed without additonal
      input.
   [] If there are special requirements to run this script (e.g. you have to
      install MUSIC), this must be explictly stated in the docstring.

    [] If a plot or figure should be produced, ensure the code includes the
       command to generate it
    [] An svg formatted image(s) can be included
