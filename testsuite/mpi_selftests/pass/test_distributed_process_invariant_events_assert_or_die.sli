 /** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_distributed_process_invariant_events_assert_or_die - self test of distributed_invariant_events_assert_or_die

Synopsis: nest_indirect distributed_process_invariant_events_assert_or_die.sli -> -


Description:

 This is a self test of
 distributed_invariant_events_assert_or_die. The function needs to be
 able to collect the results of an arbitrary number of jobs and
 compare the set of results to the one of the same simulation carried
 out with a different number of jobs.
