Name: iaf_psc_alpha_ps - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
  with alpha-shape postsynaptic currents; implementing precise
  spikes, as well as a linear interpolation to find the "exact" time where the
  threshold was crossed, i.e. the spiking time.

Description:
iaf_psc_alpha_ps is an implementation of the leaky integrate-and-fire model
neuron with alpha-shaped postsynaptic currents in the sense of [1]. This model
implements precise spikes and a linear interpolation to find spike times more
precisely.

PSCs are normalized to a maximum amplitude equal to the synaptic weight.

This implementation handles neuronal dynamics in a locally
event-based manner with in coarse time grid defined by the minimum
delay in the network, see [1]. Incoming spikes are applied at the
precise moment of their arrival, while the precise time of outgoing
spikes is determined by interpolation once a threshold crossing has
been detected. Return from refractoriness occurs precisly at spike
time plus refractory period.

This implementation is more complex than the plain iaf_psc_alpha
neuron, but achieves much higher precision. In particular, it does not
suffer any binning of spike times to grid points. Depending on your
application, the precise-spiking application may provide superior overall
performance given an accuracy goal; see [1] for details. Dynamics is integrated
using the GSL library.

Remarks:
Please note that this node is capable of sending precise spike times
to target nodes (on-grid spike time plus offset). If this node is
connected to a spike_detector, the property "precise_times" of the
spike_detector has to be set to true in order to record the offsets
in addition to the on-grid spike times.

A further improvement of precise simulation is implemented in iaf_psc_exp_ps
based on [3].

Parameters:
The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary.

  V_m          double - Membrane potential in mV
  E_L          double - Resting membrane potential in mV.
  V_min        double - Absolute lower value for the membrane potential.
  C_m          double - Capacity of the membrane in pF
  g_L          double - Leak conductance in nS.
  t_ref        double - Duration of refractory period in ms.
  V_th         double - Spike threshold in mV.
  V_reset      double - Reset potential of the membrane in mV.
  tau_syn_exc  double - Rise time of the excitatory synaptic alpha function in
ms
  tau_syn_inh  double - Rise time of the inhibitory synaptic alpha function in
ms
  I_e          double - Constant external input current in pA.
