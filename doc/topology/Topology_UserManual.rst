Topology User Manual
=====================

The Topology Module provides the NEST simulator [1]_
with a convenient interface for creating layers of neurons placed in
space and connecting neurons in such layers with probabilities and
properties depending on the relative placement of neurons. This permits
the creation of complex networks with spatial structure.

This user manual provides an introduction to the functionality provided
by the Topology Module. It is based exclusively on the PyNEST, the
Python interface to NEST. NEST users using the SLI
interface should be able to map instructions to corresponding SLI code.
This manual is not meant as a comprehensive reference manual. Please
consult the online documentation in PyNEST for details; where
appropriate, that documentation also points to relevant SLI
documentation.

This manual describes the Topology Module included with NEST 2.16; the
user interface and behavior of the module has not changed significantly
since NEST 2.2.

In the next chapter of this manual, we introduce Topology layers, which
place neurons in space. In Chapter \ :ref:`3 <sec:connections>` we then
describe how to connect layers with each other, before discussing in
Chapter \ :ref:`4 <sec:inspection>` how you can inspect and visualize
Topology networks. Chapter \ :ref:`5 <ch:extending>` deals with the more
advanced topic of extending the Topology module with custom kernel
functions and masks provided by C++ classes in an extension module.

You will find the Python scripts used in the examples in this manual in
the NEST source code directory under
``doc/topology/user_manual_scripts``.

.. _sec:limitations:

Limitations and Disclaimer
--------------------------

Undocumented features
   The Topology Module provides a number of undocumented features, which
   you may discover by browsing the code. These features are highly
   experimental and should *not be used for simulations*, as they have
   not been validated.

.. _sec:layers:

Layers
======

The Topology Module (just Topology for short in the remainder of this
document) organizes neuronal networks in *layers*. We will first
illustrate how Topology places elements in simple layers, where each
element is a single model neuron. Layers with composite elements are
discussed in the following section.

We will illustrate the definition and use of layers using examples.

Topology distinguishes between two classes of layers:

grid-based layers
   in which each element is placed at a location in a regular grid;

free layers
   in which elements can be placed arbitrarily in the plane.

Grid-based layers allow for more efficient connection-generation under
certain circumstances.

.. _sec:gridbased:

Grid-based Layers
-----------------

.. _sec:verysimple:

A very simple layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We create a first, grid-based simple layer with the following commands:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer1 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer1:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/layer1.png
   :name: fig:layer1

   Simple grid-based layer centered about the origin. Blue circles mark
   layer elements, the thin square the extent of the layer. Row and
   column indices are shown in the right and top margins, respectively.

The layer is shown in :numref:`fig_layer1`. Note the following properties:

-  The layer has five *rows* and five *columns*.

-  The ``'elements'`` entry of the dictionary passed to ``CreateLayer``
   determines the *elements* of the layer. In this case, the layer
   contains :cpp:class:`iaf_psc_alpha <nest::iaf_psc_alpha>` neurons.

-  The *center* of the layer is at the origin of the coordinate system,
   :math:`(0,0)`.

-  The *extent* or size of the layer is :math:`1\times  1`. This is the
   default size for layers. The extent is marked by the thin square in
    :numref:`fig_layer1`.

-  The *grid spacing* of the layer is

.. _dx_dy_extent:

.. math::

      \begin{split}
      dx &= \frac{\text{x-extent}}{\text{number of columns}} \\
      dy &= \frac{\text{y-extent}}{\text{number of rows}}
      \end{split}

In the layer shown, we have :math:`dx=dy=0.2`,
but the grid spacing may differ in x- and y-direction.

-  Layer elements are spaced by the grid spacing and are arranged
   symmetrically about the center.

-  The outermost layer elements are placed :math:`dx/2` and :math:`dy/2`
   from the borders of the extent.

-  Element *positions* in the coordinate system are given by
   :math:`(x,y)` pairs. The *coordinate system* follows that standard
   mathematical convention that the :math:`x`-axis runs from left to
   right and the :math:`y`-axis from bottom to top.

-  Each element of a grid-based layer has a *row- and column-index* in
   addition to its :math:`(x,y)`-coordinates. Indices are shown in the
   top and right margin of  :numref:`fig_layer1`. Note that row-indices
   follow matrix convention, i.e., run from top to bottom. Following
   pythonic conventions, indices run from 0.

.. _sec:setextent:

Setting the extent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Layers have a default extent of :math:`1\times 1`. You can specify a
different extent of a layer, i.e., its size in :math:`x`- and
:math:`y`-direction by adding an ``'extent'`` entry to the dictionary
passed to ``CreateLayer``:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer2 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer2:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/layer2.png
   :name: fig:layer2

   Same layer as in :numref:`fig_layer1`, but with different extent.

The resulting layer is shown in :numref:`fig_layer2`. The extent is always
a two-element tuple of floats. In this example, we have grid spacings
:math:`dx=0.4` and :math:`dy=0.1`. Changing the extent does not affect
grid indices.

The size of ``'extent'`` in :math:`x`- and :math:`y`-directions should
be numbers that can be expressed exactly as binary fractions. This is
automatically ensured for integer values. Otherwise, under rare
circumstances, subtle rounding errors may occur and trigger an
assertion, thus stopping NEST.

.. _sec:setcenter:

Setting the center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Layers are centered about the origin :math:`(0,0)` by default. This can
be changed through the ``'center'`` entry in the dictionary specifying
the layer. The following code creates layers centered about
:math:`(0,0)`, :math:`(-1,1)`, and :math:`(1.5,0.5)`, respectively:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer3 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer3:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/layer3.png
   :name: fig:layer3

   Three layers centered, respectively, about :math:`(0,0)` (blue),
   :math:`(-1,-1)` (green), and :math:`(1.5,0.5)` (red).

The center is given as a two-element tuple of floats. Changing the
center does not affect grid indices: For each of the three layers in
 :numref:`fig_layer3`, grid indices run from 0 to 4 through columns and
rows, respectively, even though elements in these three layers have
different positions in the global coordinate system.

The ``'center'`` coordinates should be numbers that can be expressed
exactly as binary fractions. For more information, see
Sec. \ :ref:`2.1.2 <sec:setextent>`.

.. _sec:fixedlayerexample:

Constructing a layer: an example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see how to construct a layer, consider the following example:

-  a layer with :math:`n_r` rows and :math:`n_c` columns;

-  spacing between nodes is :math:`d` in :math:`x`- and
   :math:`y`-directions;

-  the left edge of the extent shall be at :math:`x=0`;

-  the extent shall be centered about :math:`y=0`.

From Eq. :numref:`dx_dy_extent`, we see that the extent of the layer must be
:math:`(n_c d, n_r d)`. We now need to find the coordinates
:math:`(c_x, c_y)` of the center of the layer. To place the left edge of
the extent at :math:`x=0`, we must place the center of the layer at
:math:`c_x=n_c d / 2` along the :math:`x`-axis, i.e., half the extent
width to the right of :math:`x=0`. Since the layer is to be centered
about :math:`y=0`, we have :math:`c_y=0`. Thus, the center coordinates
are :math:`(n_c d/2, 0)`. The layer is created with the following code
and shown in :numref:`fig_layer3a`:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer3a #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer3a:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/layer3a.png
   :name: fig:layer3a

   Layer with :math:`n_c=5` rows and :math:`n_r=3` columns, spacing
   :math:`d=0.1` and the left edge of the extent at :math:`x=0`,
   centered about the :math:`y`-axis. The cross marks the point on the
   extent placed at the origin :math:`(0,0)`, the circle the center of
   the layer.

.. _sec:freelayer:

Free layers
-----------

*Free layers* do not restrict node positions to a grid, but allow free
placement within the extent. To this end, the user needs to specify the
positions of all nodes explicitly. The following code creates a layer of
50 :cpp:class:`iaf_psc_alpha <nest::iaf_psc_alpha>` neurons uniformly distributed in a layer with
extent :math:`1\times 1`, i.e., spanning the square
:math:`[-0.5,0.5]\times[-0.5,0.5]`:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer4 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer4:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/layer4.png
   :name: fig:layer4

   A free layer with 50 elements uniformly distributed in an extent of
   size :math:`1\times 1`.

Note the following points:

-  For free layers, element *positions* are specified by the
   ``'positions'`` entry in the dictionary passed to ``CreateLayer``.
   ``'positions'`` is mutually exclusive with ``'rows'``/``'columns'``
   entries in the dictionary.

-  The ``'positions'`` entry must be a Python ``list`` (or ``tuple``) of
   element coordinates, i.e., of two-element tuples of floats giving the
   (:math:`x`, :math:`y`)-coordinates of the elements. One layer element
   is created per element in the ``'positions'`` entry.

-  All layer element positions must be *within* the layer’s extent.
   Elements may be placed on the perimeter of the extent as long as no
   periodic boundary conditions are used; see
   Sec. \ :ref:`2.4 <sec:periodic>`.

-  Element positions in free layers are *not* shifted when specifying
   the ``'center'`` of the layer. The user must make sure that the
   positions given lie within the extent when centered about the given
   center.

.. _sec:3dlayer:

3D layers
---------

Although the term “layer” suggests a 2-dimensional structure, the layers
in NEST may in fact be 3-dimensional. The example from the previous
section may be easily extended with another component in the coordinates
for the positions:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer4_3d #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer4_3d:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/layer4_3d.png
   :name: fig:layer4_3d

   A free 3D layer with 200 elements uniformly distributed in an extent
   of size :math:`1\times 1\times 1`.

.. _sec:periodic:

Periodic boundary conditions
----------------------------

Simulations usually model systems much smaller than the biological
networks we want to study. One problem this entails is that a
significant proportion of neurons in a model network is close to the
edges of the network with fewer neighbors than nodes properly inside the
network. In the :math:`5\times 5`-layer in :numref:`fig_layer1`, e.g., 16
out of 25 nodes form the border of the layer.

One common approach to reducing the effect of boundaries on simulations
is to introduce *periodic boundary conditions*, so that the rightmost
elements on a grid are considered nearest neighbors to the leftmost
elements, and the topmost to the bottommost. The flat layer becomes the
surface of a torus.  :numref:`fig_player` illustrates this for a
one-dimensional layer, which turns from a line to a ring upon
introduction of periodic boundary conditions.

You specify periodic boundary conditions for a layer using the
dictionary entry ``edge_wrap``:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ player #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_player:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/player.png
   :name: fig:player

   Top left: Layer with single row and five columns without periodic
   boundary conditions. Numbers above elements show element coordinates.
   Colors shifting from blue to magenta mark increasing distance from
   the element at :math:`(-2,0)`. Bottom left: Same layer, but with
   periodic boundary conditions. Note that the element at :math:`(2,0)`
   now is a nearest neighbor to the element at :math:`(-2,0)`. Right:
   Layer with periodic boundary condition arranged on a circle to
   illustrate neighborhood relationships.

Note that the longest possible distance between two elements in a layer
without periodic boundary conditions is

.. math:: \sqrt{x_{\text{ext}}^2 + y_{\text{ext}}^2}

\ but only

.. math:: \left.\sqrt{x_{\text{ext}}^2 + y_{\text{ext}}^2}\right/ 2

for a layer with periodic boundary conditions; :math:`x_{\text{ext}}`
and :math:`y_{\text{ext}}` are the components of the extent size.

We will discuss the consequences of periodic boundary conditions more in
Chapter \ :ref:`3 <sec:connections>`.

.. _sec:subnet:

Topology layer as NEST subnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the perspective of NEST, a Topology layer is a special type of
*subnet*. From the user perspective, the following points may be of
interest:

-  Grid-based layers have the NEST model type ``topology_layer_grid``,
   free layers the model type ``topology_layer_free``.

-  The status dictionary of a layer has a ``'topology'`` entry
   describing the layer properties (``l`` is the layer created above):

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer1s #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.log
    :start-after: #{ layer1s.log #}
    :end-before: #{ end.log #}



The `'topology'` entry is read-only.

-  The NEST kernel sees the elements of the layer in the same way as the
   elements of any subnet. You will notice this when printing a network
   with a Topology layer:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer1p #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.log
    :start-after: #{ layer1p.log #}
    :end-before: #{ end.log #}



The `5 times` 5 layer created above appears here as a
`topology_layer_grid` subnet of 25 `iaf_psc_alpha` neurons. Only
Topology connection and visualization functions heed the spatial
structure of the layer.

.. _sec:composite_layers:

Layers with composite elements
------------------------------

So far, we have considered layers in which each element was a single
model neuron. Topology can also create layers with *composite elements*,
i.e., layers in which each element is a collection of model neurons, or,
in general NEST network nodes.

Construction of layers with composite elements proceeds exactly as for
layers with simple elements, except that the ``'elements'`` entry of the
dictionary passed to ``CreateLayer`` is a Python list or tuple. The
following code creates a :math:`1\times 2` layer (to keep the output
from :py:func:`.PrintNetwork` compact) in which each element consists of one
``'iaf_cond_alpha'`` and one ``'poisson_generator'`` node

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer6 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.log
    :start-after: #{ layer6 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

The network consist of one ``topology_layer_grid`` with four elements:
two :cpp:class:`iaf_cond_alpha <nest::iaf_cond_alpha>` and two :cpp:class:`poisson_generator <nest::poisson_generator>` nodes. The
identical nodes are grouped, so that the subnet contains first one full
layer of :cpp:class:`iaf_cond_alpha <nest::iaf_cond_alpha>` nodes followed by one full layer of
:cpp:class:`poisson_generator <nest::poisson_generator>` nodes.

You can create network elements with several nodes of each type by
following a model name with the number of nodes to be created:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer7 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.log
    :start-after: #{ layer7 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

In this case, each layer element consists of 10 :cpp:class:`iaf_cond_alpha <nest::iaf_cond_alpha>`
neurons, one :cpp:class:`poisson_generator <nest::poisson_generator>`, and two :cpp:class:`noise_generator <nest::noise_generator>`\ s.

Note the following points:

-  Each element of a layer has identical components.

-  All nodes within a composite element have identical positions, namely
   the position of the layer element.

-  When inspecting a layer as a subnet, the different nodes will appear
   in groups of identical nodes.

-  For grid-based layers, the function ``GetElement`` returns a list of
   nodes at a given grid position. See Chapter \ :ref:`4 <sec:inspection>`
   for more on inspecting layers.

-  In a previous version of the topology module it was possible to
   create layers with nested, composite elements, but such nested
   networks gobble up a lot of memory for subnet constructs and provide
   no practical advantages, so this is no longer supported. See the next
   section for design recommendations for more complex layers.

.. _sec:layerdesign:

Designing layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A paper on a neural network model might describe the network as
follows [2]_:

   The network consists of :math:`20x20` microcolumns placed on a
   regular grid spanning :math:`0.5^\circ\times 0.5^\circ` of visual
   space. Neurons within each microcolumn are organized into L2/3, L4,
   and L56 subpopulations. Each subpopulation consists of three
   pyramidal cells and one interneuron. All pyramidal cells are modeled
   as NEST :cpp:class:`iaf_psc_alpha <nest::iaf_psc_alpha>` neurons with default parameter values,
   while interneurons are :cpp:class:`iaf_psc_alpha <nest::iaf_psc_alpha>` neurons with threshold
   voltage :math:`V_{\text{th}}=-52`\ mV.

How should you implement such a network using the Topology module? The
recommended approach is to create different models for the neurons in
each layer and then define the microcolumn as one composite element:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer10 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

We will discuss in Chapter \ :ref:`3.1 <sec:conn_basics>` how to connect
selectively to different neuron models.

.. _sec:connections:

Connections
===========

The most important feature of the Topology module is the ability to
create connections between layers with quite some flexibility. In this
chapter, we will illustrate how to specify and create connections. All
connections are created using the ``ConnectLayers`` function.

.. _sec:conn_basics:

Basic principles
----------------

.. _sec:terminology:

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

We begin by introducing important terminology:

Connection
   In the context of connections between the elements of Topology
   layers, we often call the set of all connections between pairs of
   network nodes created by a single call to ``ConnectLayers`` a
   *connection*.

Connection dictionary
   A dictionary specifying the properties of a connection between two
   layers in a call to ``CreateLayers``.

Source
   The *source* of a single connection is the node sending signals
   (usually spikes). In a projection, the source layer is the layer from
   which source nodes are chosen.

Target
   The *target* of a single connection is the node receiving signals
   (usually spikes). In a projection, the target layer is the layer from
   which target nodes are chosen.

Connection type
   The *connection type* determines how nodes are selected when
   ``ConnectLayers`` creates connections between layers. It is either
   ``'convergent'`` or ``'divergent'``.

Convergent connection
   When creating a *convergent connection* between layers, Topology
   visits each node in the target layer in turn and selects sources for
   it in the source layer. Masks and kernels are applied to the source
   layer, and periodic boundary conditions are applied in the source
   layer, provided that the source layer has periodic boundary
   conditions.

Divergent connection
   When creating a *divergent connection*, Topology visits each node in
   the source layer and selects target nodes from the target layer.
   Masks, kernels, and boundary conditions are applied in the target
   layer.

Driver
   When connecting two layers, the *driver* layer is the one in which
   each node is considered in turn.

Pool
   | When connecting two layers, the *pool* layer is the one from which
     nodes are chosen for each node in the driver layer. I.e., we have

   +-----------------+--------------+--------------+
   | Connection type | Driver       | Pool         |
   +=================+==============+==============+
   | convergent      | target layer | source layer |
   +-----------------+--------------+--------------+
   | divergent       | source layer | target layer |
   +-----------------+--------------+--------------+

Displacement
   The *displacement* between a driver and a pool node is the shortest
   vector connecting the driver to the pool node, taking boundary
   conditions into account.

Distance
   The *distance* between a driver and a pool node is the length of
   their displacement.

Mask
   The *mask* defines which pool nodes are at all considered as
   potential targets for each driver node. See
   Sec. \ :ref:`3.3 <sec:conn_masks>` for details.

Kernel
   The *kernel* is a function returning a (possibly distance- or
   displacement-dependent) probability for creating a connection between
   a driver and a pool node. The default kernel is :math:`1`, i.e.,
   connections are created with certainty. See
   Sec. \ :ref:`3.4 <sec:conn_kernels>` for details.

Autapse
   An *autapse* is a synapse (connection) from a node onto itself.
   Autapses are permitted by default, but can be disabled by adding
   ``'allow_autapses': False`` to the connection dictionary.

Multapse
   Node A is connected to node B by a *multapse* if there are synapses
   (connections) from A to B. Multapses are permitted by default, but
   can be disabled by adding ``'allow_multapses': False`` to the
   connection dictionary.

.. _sec:minimalcall:

A minimal ConnectLayers call
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections between Topology layers are created by calling
``ConnectLayers`` with the following arguments [3]_:

1. The source layer.

2. The target layer (can be identical to source layer).

3. A connection dictionary that contains at least the following entry:

   ‘connection_type’
      either ``'convergent'`` or ``'divergent'``.

In many cases, the connection dictionary will also contain

‘mask’
   a mask specification as described in
   Sec. \ :ref:`3.3 <sec:conn_masks>`.

Only neurons within the mask are considered as potential sources or
targets. If no mask is given, all neurons in the respective layer are
considered sources or targets.

Here is a simple example, cf. :numref:`fig_conn1`

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn1 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn1:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/conn1.png
   :name: fig:conn1

   Left: Minimal connection example from a layer onto itself using a
   rectangular mask shown as red line for the node at :math:`(0,0)`
   (marked light red). The targets of this node are marked with red
   dots. The targets for the node at :math:`(4,5)` are marked with
   yellow dots. This node has fewer targets since it is at the corner
   and many potential targets are beyond the layer. Right: The effect of
   periodic boundary conditions is seen here. Source and target layer
   and connection dictionary were identical, except that periodic
   boundary conditions were used. The node at :math:`(4,5)` now has 15
   targets, too, but they are spread across the corners of the layer. If
   we wrapped the layer to a torus, they would form a :math:`5\times 3`
   rectangle centered on the node at :math:`(4,5)`.

In this example, layer ``l`` is both source and target layer. Connection
type is divergent, i.e., for each node in the layer we choose targets
according to the rectangular mask centered about each source node. Since
no connection kernel is specified, we connect to all nodes within the
mask. Note the effect of normal and periodic boundary conditions on the
connections created for different nodes in the layer, as illustrated in
 :numref:`fig_conn1`.

.. _sec:mapping:

Mapping source and target layers
--------------------------------

The application of masks and other functions depending on the distance
or even the displacement between nodes in the source and target layers
requires a mapping of coordinate systems between source and target
layers. Topology applies the following *coordinate mapping rules*:

1. All layers have two-dimensional Euclidean coordinate systems.

2. No scaling or coordinate transformation can be applied between
   layers.

3. The displacement :math:`d(D,P)` from node :math:`D` in the driver
   layer to node :math:`P` in the pool layer is measured by first
   mapping the position of :math:`D` in the driver layer to the
   identical position in the pool layer and then computing the
   displacement from that position to :math:`P`. If the pool layer has
   periodic boundary conditions, they are taken into account. It does
   not matter for displacement computations whether the driver layer has
   periodic boundary conditions.

.. _sec:conn_masks:

Masks
-----

A mask describes which area of the pool layer shall be searched for
nodes to connect for any given node in the driver layer. We will first
describe geometrical masks defined for all layer types and then consider
grid-based masks for grid-based layers. If no mask is specified, all
nodes in the pool layer will be searched.

Note that the mask size should not exceed the size of the layer when
using periodic boundary conditions, since the mask would “wrap around”
in that case and pool nodes would be considered multiple times as
targets.

If none of the mask types provided in the topology library meet your
need, you may add more mask types in a NEST extension module. This is
covered in Chapter \ `5 <#ch:extending>`__.

.. _sec:free_masks:

Masks for 2D layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Topology currently provides four types of masks usable for 2-dimensional
free and grid-based layers. They are illustrated in  :numref:`fig_conn2_a`.
The masks are

Rectangular
   All nodes within a rectangular area are connected. The area is
   specified by its lower left and upper right corners, measured in the
   same unit as element coordinates. Example:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2r #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Circular
   All nodes within a circle are connected. The area is specified by its
   radius.

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2c #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Doughnut
   All nodes between an inner and outer circle are connected. Note that
   nodes *on* the inner circle are not connected. The area is specified
   by the radii of the inner and outer circles.

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2d #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Elliptical
   All nodes within an ellipsis are connected. The area is specified by
   its major and minor axis. Note that this mask was added to NEST with
   NEST 2.14.

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2e #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn2_a:

   Masks for 2D layers. For all mask types, the driver node is marked by
   a wide light-red circle, the selected pool nodes by red dots and the
   masks by red lines. From left to right, top to bottom: rectangular,
   circular, doughnut and elliptical masks centered about the driver
   node.

By default, the masks are centered about the position of the driver
node, mapped into the pool layer. You can change the location of the
mask relative to the driver node by specifying an ``'anchor'`` entry in
the mask dictionary. The anchor is a 2D vector specifying the location
of the mask center relative to the driver node, as in the following
examples (cf.  :numref:`fig_conn2_b`).

.. _fig_conn2_b:

   :name: fig:conn2_b

   The same masks as in :numref:`fig_conn2_a`, but centered about
   :math:`(-1.5,-1.5)`, :math:`(-2,0)`, :math:`(1.5,1.5)` and
   :math:`(2, -1)`, respectively, using the ``'anchor'`` parameter.

and :math:`\textbf{elliptical}` masks, see Fig :numref:`fig_conn2_b`. To do so,
add an ``'azimuth_angle'`` entry in the specific mask dictionary. The
``azimuth_angle`` is measured in degrees and is the rotational angle
from the x-axis to the y-axis.

   Rotated rectangle and elliptical mask from  :numref:`fig_conn2_a` and
    :numref:`fig_conn2_b`, where the rectangle mask is rotated
   :math:`120^\circ` and the elliptical mask is rotated
   :math:`45^\circ`.

.. _sec:3d_masks:

Masks for 3D layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly, there are three mask types that can be used for 3D layers,

Box
   All nodes within a cuboid volume are connected. The area is specified
   by its lower left and upper right corners, measured in the same unit
   as element coordinates. Example:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_3d_a #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Spherical
   All nodes within a sphere are connected. The area is specified by its
   radius.

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_3d_b #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Ellipsoidal
   All nodes within an ellipsoid are connected. The area is specified by
   its major, minor, and polar axis. This mask has been part of NEST
   since NEST 2.14.

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_3d_c #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

As in the 2D case, you can change the location of the mask relative to
the driver node by specifying a 3D vector in the ``'anchor'`` entry in
the mask dictionary. If you want to rotate the box or ellipsoidal masks,
you can add an ``'azimuth_angle'`` entry in the specific mask dictionary
for rotation from the x-axis towards the y-axis about the z-axis, or an
``'polar_angle'`` entry, specifying the rotation angle in degrees from
the z-axis about the (possibly rotated) x axis, from the (possibly
rotated) y-axis. You can specify both at once of course. If both are
specified, we first rotate about the z-axis and then about the new
x-axis. NEST currently do not support rotation in all three directions,
the rotation from the y-axis about the (possibly rotated) z-axis, from
the (possibly rotated) x-axis is missing.

.. _fig_conn_3d:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/conn_3d.png
   :name: fig:conn3d

   Masks for 3D layers. For all mask types, the driver node is marked by
   a wide light-red circle, the selected pool nodes by red dots and the
   masks by red lines. From left to right: box and spherical masks
   centered about the driver node.

.. _sec:grid_masks:

Masks for grid-based layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Grid-based layers can be connected using rectangular *grid masks*. For
these, you specify the size of the mask not by lower left and upper
right corner coordinates, but give their size in rows and columns, as in
this example:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn3 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

The resulting connections are shown in  :numref:`fig_conn3`. By default the
top-left corner of a grid mask, i.e., the grid mask element with grid
index :math:`[0,0]`\  [4]_, is aligned with the driver node. You can
change this alignment by specifying an *anchor* for the mask:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn3c #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

You can even place the anchor outside the mask:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn3x #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

The resulting connection patterns are shown in  :numref:`fig_conn3`.

.. _fig_conn3:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/conn3.png
   :name: fig:conn3

   Grid masks for connections between grid-based layers. Left:
   :math:`5\times 3` mask with default alignment at upper left corner.
   Center: Same mask, but anchored to center node at grid index
   :math:`[1,2]`. Right: Same mask, but anchor to the upper left of the
   mask at grid index :math:`[-1,2]`.

Connections specified using grid masks are generated more efficiently
than connections specified using other mask types.

Note the following:

-  Grid-based masks are applied by considering grid indices. The
   position of nodes in physical coordinates is ignored.

-  In consequence, grid-based masks should only be used between layers
   with identical grid spacings.

-  The semantics of the ``'anchor'`` property for grid-based masks
   differ significantly for general masks described in
   Sec. \ :ref:`3.3.1 <sec:free_masks>`. For general masks, the anchor is
   the center of the mask relative to the driver node. For grid-based
   nodes, the anchor determines which mask element is aligned with the
   driver element.

.. _sec:conn_kernels:

Kernels
-------

Many neuronal network models employ probabilistic connection rules.
Topology supports probabilistic connections through *kernels*. A kernel
is a function mapping the distance (or displacement) between a driver
and a pool node to a connection probability. Topology then generates a
connection according to this probability.

Probabilistic connections can be generated in two different ways using
Topology:

Free probabilistic connections
   are the default. In this case, ``ConnectLayers`` considers each
   driver node :math:`D` in turn. For each :math:`D`, it evaluates the
   kernel for each pool node :math:`P` within the mask and creates a
   connection according to the resulting probability. This means in
   particular that *each possible driver-pool pair is inspected exactly
   once* and that there will be *at most one connection between each
   driver-pool pair*.

Prescribed number of connections
   can be obtained by specifying the number of connections to create per
   driver node. See Sec. \ :ref:`3.7 <sec:prescribed_numbers>` for
   details.

Available kernel functions are shown in Table :ref:`tbl_kernels`. More
kernel functions may be created in a NEST extension module. This is
covered in Chapter \ `5 <#ch:extending>`__.

.. _tbl_kernels:

Functions currently available in the Topology module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :math:`d` is the distance and :math:`(d_x,d_y)` the displacement. All
   functions can be used to specify weights and delays, but only the
   constant and the distance-dependent functions, i.e., all functions above
   the double line, can be used as kernels.

.. _fig_conn4:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/conn4.png
   :name: fig:conn4

   Illustration of various kernel functions. Top left: constant kernel,
   :math:`p=0.5`. Top center: Gaussian kernel, green dashed lines show
   :math:`\sigma`, :math:`2\sigma`, :math:`3\sigma`. Top right: Same
   Gaussian kernel anchored at :math:`(1.5,1.5)`. Bottom left: Same
   Gaussian kernel, but all :math:`p<0.5` treated as :math:`p=0`. Bottom
   center: 2D-Gaussian.

Several examples follow. They are illustrated in  :numref:`fig_conn4`.

Constant
   The simplest kernel is a fixed connection probability:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn4cp #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Gaussian
   This kernel is distance dependent. In the example, connection
   probability is 1 for :math:`d=0` and falls off with a “standard
   deviation” of :math:`\sigma=1`:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn4g #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Eccentric Gaussian
   In this example, both kernel and mask have been moved using anchors:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn4gx #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}



Note that the anchor for the kernel is specified inside the
dictionary containing the parameters for the Gaussian.

Cut-off Gaussian
   In this example, all probabilities less than :math:`0.5` are set to
   zero:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn4cut #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

2D Gaussian
   We conclude with an example using a two-dimensional Gaussian, i.e., a
   Gaussian with different widths in :math:`x`- and :math:`y-`
   directions. This kernel depends on displacement, not only on
   distance:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn42d #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Note that for pool layers with periodic boundary conditions, Topology
always uses the shortest possible displacement vector from driver to
pool neuron as argument to the kernel function.

.. _sec:conn_wd:

Weights and delays
------------------

The functions presented in Table :ref:`tbl_kernels` can also be used to
specify distance-dependent or randomized weights and delays for the
connections created by ``ConnectLayers``.

Figure :numref:`fig_conn5` illustrates weights and delays generated using these
functions with the following code examples. All examples use a “layer”
of 51 nodes placed on a line; the line is centered about :math:`(25,0)`,
so that the leftmost node has coordinates :math:`(0,0)`. The distance
between neighboring elements is 1. The mask is rectangular, spans the
entire layer and is centered about the driver node.

Linear example

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn5lin #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Results are shown in the top panel of  :numref:`fig_conn5`. Connection
weights and delays are shown for the leftmost neuron as driver. Weights
drop linearly from :math:`1`. From the node at :math:`(20,0)` on, the
cutoff sets weights to 0. There are no connections to nodes beyond
:math:`(25,0)`, since the mask extends only 25 units to the right of the
driver. Delays increase in a stepwise linear fashion, as NEST requires
delays to be multiples of the simulation resolution.

Linear example with periodic boundary conditions

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn5linpbc #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Results are shown in the middle panel of  :numref:`fig_conn5`. This example
is identical to the previous, except that the (pool) layer has periodic
boundary conditions. Therefore, the left half of the mask about the node
at :math:`(0,0)` wraps back to the right half of the layer and that node
connects to all nodes in the layer.

Various functions

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn5exp #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn5gauss #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Results are shown in the bottom panel of :numref:`fig_conn5`. It shows
linear, exponential and Gaussian weight functions for the node at
:math:`(25,0)`.

Randomized weights and delays

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn5uniform #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

By using the ``'uniform'`` function for weights or delays, one can
obtain randomized values for weights and delays, as shown by the red
circles in the bottom panel of :numref:`fig_conn5`. Weights and delays can
currently only be randomized with uniform distribution.

.. _fig_conn5:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/conn5.png
   :name: fig:conn5

   Distance-dependent and randomized weights and delays. See text for
   details.

.. _sec:conn_pbc:

Periodic boundary conditions
----------------------------

Connections between layers with periodic boundary conditions are based
on the following principles:

-  Periodic boundary conditions are always applied in the pool layer. It
   is irrelevant whether the driver layer has periodic boundary
   conditions or not.

-  By default, Topology does not accept masks that are wider than the
   pool layer when using periodic boundary conditions. Otherwise, one
   pool node could appear as multiple targets to the same driver node as
   the masks wraps several times around the layer. For layers with
   different extents in :math:`x`- and :math:`y`-directions this means
   that the maximum layer size is determined by the smaller extension.

-  Kernel, weight and delay functions always consider the shortest
   distance (displacement) between driver and pool node.

In most physical systems simulated using periodic boundary conditions,
interactions between entities are short-range. Periodic boundary
conditions are well-defined in such cases. In neuronal network models
with long-range interactions, periodic boundary conditions may not make
sense. In general, we recommend to use periodic boundary conditions only
when connection masks are significantly smaller than the layers they are
applied to.

.. _sec:prescribed_numbers:

Prescribed number of connections
--------------------------------

We have so far described how to connect layers by either connecting to
all nodes inside the mask or by considering each pool node in turn and
connecting it according to a given probability function. In both cases,
the number of connections generated depends on mask and kernel.

Many neuron models in the literature, in contrast, prescribe a certain
*fan in* (number of incoming connections) or *fan out* (number of
outgoing connections) for each node. You can achieve this in Topology by
prescribing the number of connections for each driver node. For
convergent connections, where the target layer is the driver layer, you
thus achieve a constant fan in, for divergent connections a constant fan
out.

Connection generation now proceeds in a different way than before:

1. For each driver node, ``ConnectLayers`` randomly selects a node from
   the mask region in the pool layer, and creates a connection with the
   probability prescribed by the kernel. This is repeated until the
   requested number of connections has been created.

2. Thus, if all nodes in the mask shall be connected with equal
   probability, you should not specify any kernel.

3. If you specify a non-uniform kernel (e.g., Gaussian, linear,
   exponential), the connections will be distributed within the mask
   with the spatial profile given by the kernel.

4. If you prohibit multapses (cf Sec. \ :ref:`3.1.1 <sec:terminology>`)
   and prescribe a number of connections greater than the number of pool
   nodes in the mask, ``ConnectLayers`` may get stuck in an infinite
   loop and NEST will hang. Keep in mind that the number of nodes within
   the mask may vary considerably for free layers with randomly placed
   nodes.

The following code generates a network of 1000 randomly placed nodes and
connects them with a fixed fan out of 50 outgoing connections per node
distributed with a profile linearly decaying from unit probability to
zero probability at distance :math:`0.5`. Multiple connections
(multapses) between pairs of nodes are allowed, self-connections
(autapses) prohibited. The probability of finding a connection at a
certain distance is then given by the product of the probabilities for
finding nodes at a certain distance with the kernel value for this
distance. For the kernel and parameter values below we have

.. _eq_ptheo:

.. math::

   p_{\text{conn}}(d) = \frac{12}{\pi} \times 2\pi r \times (1-2r)
    = 24 r (1-2r) \qquad \text{for} \quad 0\le r < \frac{1}{2}\;.\qquad

The resulting distribution of distances between connected nodes is shown in
 :numref:`fig_conn6`.

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn6 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn6:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/conn6.png
   :name: fig:conn6

   Distribution of distances between source and target for a network of
   1000 randomly placed nodes, a fixed fan out of 50 connections and a
   connection probability decaying linearly from 1 to 0 at
   :math:`d=0.5`. The red line is the expected distribution from
   Eq. :numref:`eq_ptheo`.

Functions determining weight and delay as function of
distance/displacement work in just the same way as before when the
number of connections is prescribed.

.. _sec:conn_composite:

Connecting composite layers
---------------------------

Connections between layers with composite elements are based on the
following principles:

-  All nodes within a composite element have the same coordinates, the
   coordinates of the element.

-  All nodes within a composite element are treated equally. If, e.g.,
   an element of the pool layer contains three nodes and connection
   probability is 1, then connections with all three nodes will be
   created. For probabilistic connection schemes, each of the three
   nodes will be considered individually.

-  If only nodes of a given model within each element shall be
   considered as sources or targets then this can be achieved by adding
   a ``'sources'`` or ``'targets'`` entry to the connection dictionary,
   which specifies the model to connect.

This is exemplified by the following code, which connects pyramidal
cells (``pyr``) to interneurons (:term:`in`) with a circular mask and
uniform probability and interneurons to pyramidal cells with a
rectangular mask unit probability.

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn7 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _sec:conn_synapse:

Synapse models and properties
-----------------------------

By default, ``ConnectLayers`` creates connections using the default
synapse model in NEST, ``static_synapse``. You can specify a different
model by adding a ``'synapse_model'`` entry to the connection
dictionary, as in this example:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn8 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

You have to use synapse models if you want to set, e.g., the receptor
type of connections or parameters for plastic synapse models. These can
not be set in distance-dependent ways at present.

.. _sec:dev_subregions:

Connecting devices to subregions of layers
------------------------------------------

It is possible to connect stimulation and recording devices only to
specific subregions of layers. A simple way to achieve this is to create
a layer which contains only the device placed typically in its center.
For connecting the device layer to a neuron layer, an appropriate mask
needs to be specified and optionally also an anchor for shifting the
center of the mask. As demonstrated in the following example,
stimulation devices require the divergent connection type

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn9 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

while recording devices require the convergent connection type (see also
Sec. \ :ref:`3.11 <sec:rec_dev>`):

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn10 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _sec:rec_dev:

Layers and recording devices
----------------------------

Generally, one should not create a layer of recording devices,
especially spike detectors, to record from a topology layer. Instead,
create a single spike detector, and connect all neurons in the layer to
that spike detector using a normal connect command:

.. literalinclude:: user_manual_scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn11 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Connections to a layer of recording devices as described in
Sec. \ :ref:`3.10 <sec:dev_subregions>`, such as spike detectors, are only
possible using the convergent connection type without a fixed number of
connections. Note that voltmeter and multimeter are not suffering from
this restriction, since they are connected as sources, not as targets.

.. _sec:inspection:

Inspecting Layers
=================

We strongly recommend that you inspect the layers created by Topology to
be sure that node placement and connectivity indeed turned out as
expected. In this chapter, we describe some functions that NEST and
Topology provide to query and visualize networks, layers, and
connectivity.

.. _sec:queries:

Visualization functions

Topology provides three functions to visualize networks:

+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``PlotLayer()``   | Plot nodes in a layer.                   |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``PlotTargets()`` | Plot all targets of a node in a given    |

|                   | boundary conditions. This function is    |
|                   | usually called by ``PlotTargets``.       |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------+

.. _fig_vislayer:

.. figure:: user_manual_figures/vislayer.png
   :name: fig:vislayer

   :math:`21\times 21` grid with divergent Gaussian projections onto
   itself. Blue circles mark layer elements, red circles connection
   targets of the center neuron (marked by large light-red circle). The
   large red circle is the mask, the dashed green lines mark
   :math:`\sigma`, :math:`2\sigma` and :math:`3\sigma` of the Gaussian
   kernel.

The following code shows a practical example: A :math:`21\times21`
network which connects to itself with divergent Gaussian connections.
The resulting graphics is shown in :numref:`fig_vislayer`. All elements
and the targets of the center neuron are shown, as well as mask and
kernel.

.. _ch:extending:

Adding topology kernels and masks
=================================

This chapter will show examples of how to extend the topology module by
adding custom kernel functions and masks. Some knowledge of the C++
programming language is needed for this. The functions will be added as
a part of an extension module which is dynamically loaded into NEST. For
more information on writing an extension module, see the section titled
`“Writing an Extension
Module” <http://nest.github.io/nest-simulator/extension_modules>`__ in
the NEST Developer Manual. The basic steps required to get started are:

1. From the NEST source directory, copy directory examples/MyModule to
   somewhere outside the NEST source, build or install directories.

2. Change to the new location of MyModule and prepare by issuing
   ``./bootstrap.sh``

3. Leave MyModule and create a build directory for it, e.g., mmb next to
   it

   .. code:: bash

      cd ..
      mkdir mmb
      cd mmb

4. Configure. The configure process uses the script ``nest-config`` to
   find out where NEST is installed, where the source code resides, and
   which compiler options were used for compiling NEST. If
   ``nest-config`` is not in your path, you need to provided it
   explicitly like this

   .. code:: bash

      cmake -Dwith-nest=${NEST_INSTALL_DIR}/bin/nest-config ../MyModule

5. MyModule will then be installed to ``\${NEST_INSTALL_DIR}``. This
   ensures that NEST will be able to find initializing SLI files for the
   module. You should not use the ``--prefix`` to select a different
   installation destination. If you do, you must make sure to use
   addpath in SLI before loading the module to ensure that NEST will
   find the SLI initialization file for your module.

6. Compile.

   .. code:: bash

      make
      make install

   The previous command installed MyModule to the NEST installation
   directory, including help files generated from the source code.

Adding kernel functions
-----------------------

As an example, we will add a kernel function called ``'affine2d'``,
which will be linear (actually affine) in the displacement of the nodes,
on the form

.. math:: p(d) = a d_x + b d_y + c.

\ The kernel functions are provided by C++ classes subclassed from
``nest::Parameter``. To enable subclassing, add the following lines at
the top of the file ``mymodule.h``:

.. code:: c

   #include "topologymodule.h"
   #include "parameter.h"

Then, add the class definition, e.g. near the bottom of the file before
the brace closing the namespace ``mynest``:

.. code:: c

     class Affine2DParameter: public nest::Parameter
     {
     public:
       Affine2DParameter(const DictionaryDatum& d):
         Parameter(d),
         a_(1.0),
         b_(1.0),
         c_(0.0)
         {
           updateValue<double>(d, "a", a_);
           updateValue<double>(d, "b", b_);
           updateValue<double>(d, "c", c_);
         }

       double raw_value(const nest::Position<2>& disp,
                        librandom::RngPtr&) const
         {
           return a_*disp[0] + b_*disp[1] + c_;
         }

       nest::Parameter * clone() const
         { return new Affine2DParameter(*this); }

     private:
       double a_, b_, c_;
     };

The class contains a constructor, which reads the value of the
parameters :math:`a`, :math:`b` and :math:`c` from the dictionary
provided by the user. The function ``updateValue`` will do nothing if
the given key is not in the dictionary, and the default values
:math:`a=b=1,\ c=0` will be used.

The overridden method ``raw_value()`` will return the actual value of
the kernel function for the displacement given as the first argument,
which is of type ``nest::Position<2>``. The template argument 2 refers
to a 2-dimensional position. You can also implement a method taking a
``nest::Position<3>`` as the first argument if you want to support
3-dimensional layers. The second argument, a random number generator, is
not used in this example.

The class also needs to have a ``clone()`` method, which will return a
dynamically allocated copy of the object. We use the (default) copy
constructor to implement this.

To make the custom function available to the Topology module, you need
to register the class you have provided. To do this, add the line

.. code:: c

   nest::TopologyModule::register_parameter<Affine2DParameter>("affine2d");

to the function ``MyModule::init()`` in the file ``mymodule.cpp``. Now
compile and install the module by issuing

.. code:: bash

   make
   make install

To use the function, the module must be loaded into NEST using
``nest.Install()``. Then, the function is available to be used in
connections, e.g.

::

   nest.Install('mymodule')
   l = tp.CreateLayer({'rows': 11, 'columns': 11, 'extent': [1.,1.],
                           'elements': 'iaf_psc_alpha'})
   tp.ConnectLayers(l,l,{'connection_type': 'convergent',
               'mask': {'circular': {'radius': 0.5}},
               'kernel': {'affine2d': {'a': 1.0, 'b': 2.0, 'c': 0.5}}})

Adding masks
------------

The process of adding a mask is similar to that of adding a kernel
function. A subclass of ``nest::Mask<D>`` must be defined, where ``D``
is the dimension (2 or 3). In this case we will define a 2-dimensional
elliptic mask by creating a class called ``EllipticMask``. Note that
elliptical masks are already part of NEST see
Sec. \ :ref:`3.3 <sec:conn_masks>`. That elliptical mask is defined in a
different way than what we will do here though, so this can still be
used as an introductory example. First, we must include another header
file:

.. code:: c

   #include "mask.h"

Compared to the ``Parameter`` class discussed in the previous section,
the ``Mask`` class has a few more methods that must be overridden:

.. code:: c

     class EllipticMask : public nest::Mask<2>
     {
     public:
       EllipticMask(const DictionaryDatum& d):
         rx_(1.0), ry_(1.0)
         {
           updateValue<double>(d, "r_x", rx_);
           updateValue<double>(d, "r_y", ry_);
         }

       using Mask<2>::inside;

       // returns true if point is inside the ellipse
       bool inside(const nest::Position<2> &p) const
         { return p[0]*p[0]/rx_/rx_ + p[1]*p[1]/ry_/ry_ <= 1.0; }

       // returns true if the whole box is inside the ellipse
       bool inside(const nest::Box<2> &b) const
         {
           nest::Position<2> p = b.lower_left;

           // Test if all corners are inside mask
           if (not inside(p)) return false;       // (0,0)
           p[0] = b.upper_right[0];
           if (not inside(p)) return false;       // (0,1)
           p[1] = b.upper_right[1];
           if (not inside(p)) return false;       // (1,1)
           p[0] = b.lower_left[0];
           if (not inside(p)) return false;       // (1,0)

           return true;
         }

       // returns bounding box of ellipse
       nest::Box<2> get_bbox() const
         {
           nest::Position<2> ll(-rx_,-ry_);
           nest::Position<2> ur(rx_,ry_);
           return nest::Box<2>(ll,ur);
         }

       nest::Mask<2> * clone() const
         { return new EllipticMask(*this); }

     protected:
       double rx_, ry_;
     };

The overridden methods include a test if a point is inside the mask, and
for efficiency reasons also a test if a box is fully inside the mask. We
implement the latter by testing if all the corners are inside, since our
elliptic mask is convex. We must also define a function which returns a
bounding box for the mask, i.e. a box completely surrounding the mask.

Similar to kernel functions, the mask class must be registered with the
topology module, and this is done by adding a line to the function
``MyModule::init()`` in the file ``mymodule.cpp``:

.. code:: c

       nest::TopologyModule::register_mask<EllipticMask>("elliptic");

After compiling and installing the module, the mask is available to be
used in connections, e.g.

::

   nest.Install('mymodule')
   l = tp.CreateLayer({'rows': 11, 'columns': 11, 'extent': [1.,1.],
                           'elements': 'iaf_psc_alpha'})
   tp.ConnectLayers(l,l,{'connection_type': 'convergent',
               'mask': {'elliptic': {'r_x': 0.5, 'r_y': 0.25}}})

.. _sec:changes:

Changes between versions
========================

In this chapter we give summaries of the most important changes in the
Topology Module between different NEST versions, starting with the most
recent ones.

Changes from Topology 2.14 to 2.16
----------------------------------

The one important change in the Topology module from NEST version 2.14
to 2.16 was the inclusion of rotated masks:

-  Rotation of ``rectangular/box`` and ``elliptical/ellipsoidal`` masks
   is now possible. NEST offers rotation in two directions, from the
   x-axis towards the y-axis, and from the z-axis away from the y-axis.
   To specify the former use the variable ``azimuth_angle`` and for the
   latter, use ``polar_angle``.

Changes from Topology 2.12 to 2.14
----------------------------------

This is a short summary of the most important changes in the Topology
Module from NEST version 2.12 to 2.14.

-  Elliptical and ellipsoidal masks have been added to NEST with
   NEST 2.14. To specify the mask, the ``major_axis``, ``minor_axis``
   and (for ellipsoidal masks) ``polar_axis`` must be specified.

-  It is now possible to obtain the GIDs inside a masked area with the
   function SelectNodesByMask.

Changes from Topology 2.0 to 2.2
--------------------------------

This is a short summary of the most important changes in the Topology
Module from NEST version 2.0 to 2.2.

-  Nested layers are no longer supported.

-  Subnets are no longer used inside composite layers. A call to
   GetElement for a composite layer will now return a list of GIDs for
   the nodes at the position rather than a single subnet GID.

-  Positions in layers may now be 3-dimensional.

-  The functions GetPosition, Displacement and Distance now only works
   for nodes local to the current MPI process, if used in a MPI-parallel
   simulation.

-  It is now possible to add kernel functions and masks to the Topology
   module through an extension module. Please see
   Chapter \ `5 <#ch:extending>`__ for examples.

Changes from Topology 1.9 to 2.0
--------------------------------

This is a short summary of the most important changes in the NEST
Topology Module from the 1.9-xxxx to the 2.0 version.

-  ConnectLayer is now called ConnectLayers

-  Several other functions changed names, and there are many new
   functions. Please see Ch. \ :ref:`4 <sec:inspection>` for an overview.

-  All nest.topology functions now require lists of GIDs as input, not
   "naked" GIDs

-  There are a number of new functions in nest.topology, I tried to
   write good doc strings for them

-  For grid based layers (ie those with /rows and /columns), we have
   changed the definition of "extent": Previously, nodes were placed on
   the edges of the extent, so if you had an extend of 2 (in
   x-direction) and 3 nodes, these had x-coordinates -1, 0, 1. The grid
   constant was extent/(num_nodes - 1).

   Now, we define the grid constant as extent/num_nodes, center the
   nodes about 0 and thus add a space of half a grid constant between
   the outermost nodes and the boundary of the extent. If you want three
   nodes at -1,0,1 you thus have to set the extent to 3, i.e.,
   stretching from -1.5 to 1.5.

   The main reason for this change was that topology always added this
   padding silently when you used periodic boundary conditions
   (otherwise, neurons are the left and right edge would have been in
   identical locations, not what one wants).

-  The semantics of the ``anchor`` entry for kernel functions has
   changed: the anchor now specifies the center of the probability
   distribution relative to the driver node. This is consistent with the
   semantics for free masks, see Sec. \ :ref:`3.3 <sec:conn_masks>` and
   :ref:`3.4 <sec:conn_kernels>`.

-  Functions computing connection probabilities, weights and delays as
   functions of distance between source and target nodes now handle
   periodic boundary conditions correctly.

-  Masks with a diameter larger than the diameter of the layer they are
   applied to are now prohibited by default. This avoids multiple
   connections when masks overwrap.
