Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_poisson_generator - test basic properties of sinusoidal poisson generator

Synopsis:

(test_sinusoidal_poisson_generator) run -> dies if assertion fails


Description:

This test asserts that 
	- that /individual_spike_trains is true by default 
	- the /individual_spike_trains property can be set on the model, but not on instances 
	- that instances inherit the correct /individual_spike_trains value 
	- that different targets (on same or different threads) 
* identical spike trains if /individual_spike_trains is false 
* different spike trains otherwise 
	- that a multimeter can be connected to record the rate 
* independent of /individual_spike_trains ..., only a single trace is returned 
	- the recorded rate profile is tested against expectation 
This test DOES NOT test the statistical properties of the spike trains generated.
