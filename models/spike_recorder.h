Short description
+++++++++++++++++

Collecting spikes from neurons

Description
+++++++++++

The most universal collector device is the ``spike_recorder``, which
collects and records all *spikes* it receives from neurons that are
connected to it. Each spike received by the spike recorder is
immediately handed over to the selected recording backend for further
processing.

Any node from which spikes are to be recorded, must be connected to
the spike recorder using the standard ``Connect`` command. The
connection ``weights`` and ``delays`` are ignored by the spike
recorder, which means that the spike recorder records the time of
spike creation rather than that of their arrival.

::

   >>> neurons = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', 5)
   >>> sr = nest.Create('spike_recorder')
   >>> nest.Connect(neurons, sr)

The call to ``Connect`` will fail if the connection direction is
reversed (i.e., connecting *sr* to *neurons*).
