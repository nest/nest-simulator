Name: testsuite::issue-264 - Ensure error is raised on times incommensurate with resolution

Synopsis:

(issue-264) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test ensures that NEST raises an error if the requested simulation 
time is not a multiple of the resolution, or if one attempts to set 
start/stop/origin for devices that are not multiples of the resolution.
