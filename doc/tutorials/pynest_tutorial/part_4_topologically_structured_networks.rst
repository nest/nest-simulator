Part 4: Topologically structured networks
=========================================

Introduction
------------

This handout covers the use of NEST’s ``topology`` library to construct
structured networks. When you have worked through this material you will
be able to:

-  Create populations of neurons with specific spatial locations
-  Define connectivity profiles between populations
-  Connect populations using profiles
-  Visualise the connectivity

For more information on the usage of PyNEST, please see the other
sections of this primer:

- :doc:`Part 1: Neurons and simple neural networks <part_1_neurons_and_simple_neural_networks>`
- :doc:`Part 2: Populations of neurons <part_2_populations_of_neurons>`
- :doc:`Part 3: Connecting networks with synapses <part_3_connecting_networks_with_synapses>`

More advanced examples can be found at :doc:`Example
Networks <../../auto_examples/index>`, or
have a look at at the source directory of your NEST installation in the
subdirectory: ``pynest/examples/``.

Incorporating structure in networks of point neurons
----------------------------------------------------

If we use biologically detailed models of a neuron, then it’s easy to
understand and implement the concepts of topology, as we already have
dendritic arbors, axons, etc. which are the physical prerequisites for
connectivity within the nervous system. However, we can still get a
level of specificity using networks of point neurons.

Structure, both in the topological and everyday sense, can be thought of
as a set of rules governing the location of objects and the connections
between them. Within networks of point neurons, we can distinguish
between three types of specificity:

-  Cell-type specificity – what sorts of cells are there?
-  Location specificity – where are the cells?
-  Projection specificity – which cells do they project to, and how?

In the previous handouts, we saw that we can create deterministic or
randomly selected connections between networks using ``Connect()``. If
we want to create network models that incorporate the spatial location
and spatial connectivity profiles, it is time to turn to the
``topology`` module. **NOTE:** Full documentation for usage of the
topology module is present in NEST Topology Users Manual (NTUM)
[1]_, which in the following pages is referenced as a
full-source.

The nest.topology module
------------------------

The ``nest.topology`` module allows us to create populations of nodes
with a given spatial organisation, connection profiles which specify how
neurons are to be connected, and provides a high-level connection
routine. We can thus create structured networks by designing the
connection profiles to give the desired specificity for cell-type,
location and projection.

The generation of structured networks is carried out in three steps,
each of which will be explained in the subsequent sections in more
detail:

1. **Defining layers**, in which we assign the layout and types of the
   neurons within a layer of our network.

2. **Defining connection profiles**, where we generate the profiles that
   we wish our connections to have. Each connection dictionary specifies
   the properties for one class of connection, and contains parameters
   that allow us to tune the profile. These are related to the
   location-dependent likelihood of choosing a target (``mask`` and
   ``kernel``), and the cell-type specificity i.e. which types of cell
   in a layer can participate in the connection class (``sources`` and
   ``targets``).

3. **Connecting layers**, in which we apply the connection dictionaries
   between layers, equivalent to population-specificity. Note that
   multiple dictionaries can be applied between two layers, just as a
   layer can be connected to itself.

4. **Auxillary**, in which we visualise the results of the above steps
   either by ``nest.PrintNetwork()`` or visualization functions included
   in the topology module and query the connections for further
   analysis.

Defining layers
---------------

The code for defining a layer follows this template:

::

    import nest.topology as topp
    my_layer_dict = {...} # see below for options
    my_layer = topp.CreateLayer(my_layer_dict)

where ``my_layer_dict`` will define the elements of the layer and their
locations.

The choice of nodes to fill the ``layer`` is specified using the
``elements`` key. For the moment, we’ll only concern ourselves with
creating simple layers, where each element is from a homogeneous
population. Then, the corresponding value for this dictionary entry
should is the model type of the neuron, which can either be an existing
model in the ``NEST`` collection, or one that we’ve previously defined
using ``CopyModel()``.

We next have to decide whether the nodes should be placed in a
**grid-based** or **free** (off-grid) fashion, which is equivalent to
asking \`\`can the elements of our network be regularly and evenly
placed within a 2D network, or do we need to tell them where they should
be located?".

1 - On-grid
~~~~~~~~~~~

we have to explicitly specify the size and spacing of the grid, by the
number or rows *m* and columns *n* as well as the extent (layer size).
The grid spacing i then determined from these, and *n*\ x\ *m* elements
are arranged symmetrically. Note that we can also specify a center to
the grid, else the default offset is the origin.

The following snippet produces :numref:`grid`:

::

    layer_dict_ex = {"extent" : [2.,2.], # the size of the layer in mm
                     "rows" : 10, # the number of rows in this layer ...
                     "columns" : 10, # ... and the number of columns
                     "elements" : "iaf_psc_alpha"} # the element at each (x,y) coordinate in the grid

2 - Off grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~

we define only the elements, their positions and the extent. The number
of elements created is equivalent to the length of the list of
positions. This option allows much more flexibility in how we distribute
neurons. Note that we should also specify the extent, if the positions
fall outside of the default (extent size = [1,1] and origin as the
center). See Section 2.2 in NUTM for more details.

The following snippet produces :numref:`free`:

::

    import numpy as np
    # grid with jitter
    jit = 0.03
    xs = np.arange(-0.5,.501,0.1)
    poss = [[x,y] for y in xs for x in xs]
    poss = [[p[0]+np.random.uniform(-jit,jit),p[1]+np.random.uniform(-jit,jit)] for p in poss]
    layer_dict_ex = {"positions": poss,
            "extent" : [1.1,1.1],
            "elements" : "iaf_psc_alpha"}

Note: The topology module does support 3D ``layer``\ s, but this is
outside the scope of this handout.

they are primarily used for grid-based or free layers, follows:

Advanced
~~~~~~~~

**Composite layers** can also be created. This layer type extends the
grid-based layer and allows us to define a number of neurons and other
elements, such as ``poisson_generators``, at each grid location. A full
explanation is available in Section 2.5 of NTUM. The advantages in this
approach is that, if we want to have a layer in which each element or
subnetwork has the same composition of components, then it’s very easy
to define a layer which has these properties. For a simple example,
let’s consider a grid of elements, where each element comprises of 4
pyramidal cells, 1 interneuron, 1 poisson generator and 1 noise
generator. The corresponding code is:

::

    nest.CopyModel("iaf_psc_alpha","pyr")
    nest.CopyModel("iaf_psc_alpha","inh", {"V_th": -52.})
    comp_layer = topp.CreateLayer({"rows":5,"columns":5,
            "elements": ["pyr",4,"inh","poisson_generator","noise_generator"]})

Defining connection profiles
----------------------------

To define the types of connections that we want between populations of
neurons, we specify a *connection dictionary*.

The only two mandatory parameters for any connection dictionary are
``connection_type`` and ``mask``. All others allow us to tune our
connectivity profiles by tuning the likelihood of a connection, the
synapse type, the weight and/or delay associated with a connection, or
the number of connections, as well as specifying restrictions on cell
types that can participate in the connection class.

Chapter 3 in NTUM deals comprehensively with all the different
possibilities, and it’s suggested that you look there for learning about
the different constraints, as well as reading through the different
examples listed there. Here are some representative examples for setting
up a connectivity profile, and the following table lists the parameters
that can be used.

Connecting layers
-----------------

Connecting layers is the easiest step: having defined a source layer, a
target layer and a connection dictionary, we simply use the function
``topp.ConnectLayers()``:

::

    ex_layer = topp.CreateLayer({"rows":5,"columns":5,"elements":"iaf_psc_alpha"})
    in_layer = topp.CreateLayer({"rows":4,"columns":4,"elements":"iaf_psc_alpha"})
    conn_dict_ex = {"connection_type":"divergent","mask":{"circular":{"radius":0.5}}}
    # And now we connect E->I
    topp.ConnectLayers(ex_layer,in_layer,conn_dict_ex)

Note that we can define several dictionaries, use the same dictionary
multiple times and connect to the same layer:

::

    # Extending the code from above ... we add a conndict for inhibitory neurons
    conn_dict_in = {"connection_type":"divergent",
            "mask":{"circular":{"radius":0.75}},"weights":-4.}
    # And finish connecting the rest of the layers:
    topp.ConnectLayers(ex_layer,ex_layer,conn_dict_ex) # Connect E->E
    topp.ConnectLayers(in_layer,in_layer,conn_dict_in) # Connect I->I
    topp.ConnectLayers(in_layer,ex_layer,conn_dict_in) # Connect I->E

Visualising and querying the network structure
------------------------------------------------

There are two main methods that we can use for checking that our network
was built correctly:

-  ``nest.PrintNetwork(depth=1)``

   which prints out all the neurons and subnetworks within the network
   in text form. This is a good manner in which to inspect the hierarchy
   of composite layers;

-  `create plots using functions in
   ``nest.topology`` <http://www.nest-simulator.org/pynest-topology/>`__

   There are three functions that can be combined:

   -  ``PlotLayer``
   -  ``PlotTargets``
   -  ``PlotKernel``

   which allow us to generate the plots used with NUTM and this handout.
   See Section 4.2 of NTUM for more details.

Other useful functions that may be of help, in addition to those already
listed in NTUM Section 4.1, are:
