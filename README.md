NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the
dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact
morphology of individual neurons.

A NEST simulation tries to follow the logic of an electrophysiological
experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference that the
neural system to be investigated must be defined by the experimenter.

NEST is ideal for networks of spiking neurons of any size, for example:

- Models of information processing, e.g., in the visual or auditory cortex of
  mammals,
- Models of network activity dynamics, e.g., laminar cortical networks or
  balanced random networks,
- Models of learning and plasticity.

## Key features of NEST

* NEST provides a Python interface or a stand-alone application
* NEST provides a large collection of [neurons and synapse models](https://nest-simulator.org/documentation/models/index.html)
* NEST provides numerous [example network scripts](https://nest-simulator.org/documentation/examples/index.html) along with
  [tutorials and guides](https://nest-simulator.org/documentation/get-started_index.html) to help you develop your simulation
* NEST has a large community of experienced developers and users; NEST was first released in 1994 under the name SYNOD, and has been extended and improved ever since
* NEST is extensible: you can extend NEST by adding your own modules
* NEST is scalable: Use NEST on your laptop or the largest supercomputers
* NEST is memory efficient: It makes the best use of your multi-core computer and compute clusters with minimal user intervention
* NEST is an open source project and is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 or later
* NEST employs continuous integration workflows in order to maintain high code quality standards for correct and reproducible simulations
