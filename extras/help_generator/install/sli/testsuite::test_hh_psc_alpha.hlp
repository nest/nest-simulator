Name: testsuite::test_hh_psc_alpha - sli script for hh_psc_alpha model

Synopsis:

(test_hh_psc_alpha) run -> 'rates.txt'


Description:

test_hh_psc_alpha produces a rate-response (FI) curve of the Hogkin-Huxley 
neuron  in response to a range of different current (DC) stimulations. 
The result is stored in an extra file, rates.txt, and can be plotted, 
e.g. in matlab using 
x=load('hh_rates.txt'); plot(x(:,1),x(:,2)) 
or 
plot "hh_rates.txt" with lines; 
in gnuplot 
Since a DC input affetcs only the neuron's channel dynamics, this routine 
does not yet check correctness of synaptic response.
