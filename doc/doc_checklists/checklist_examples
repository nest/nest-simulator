       (no heading), Notes (optional), References, See Also, author, KEYWORDS)
    [] Summary line; title that briefly describes example, on same line as """
    [] Summary line is underlined with dashes extending beyond the text.
    [] **Only one** docstring allowed in example script (see section additional 
       comments, for including comments within code)
    [] Variables, paths, functions and objects should be surrounded by double
       back ticks (e.g. ``var``).

- Extended Summary Section and Notes section

   [] Below summary line, there should be an extended summary section that
      describes the purpose of example and the models used within. A brief
      desription of the steps involved in plain English should be included.
   [] Background theory or mathematical equations should be included in the Notes 
      section, but this is optional.

- Math Format

    [] Model equations should not be included in the examples. But if some form
       of math is required, only include them in the Notes section.
    [] Equation in LaTeX format using reST math directive or math role

- See Also section

     [] The last section should be the See Also section that includes filenames 
        of 2 or 3 related examples or other related docs.

- author

   [] Author(s) who contributed example is included

   [] Comments in code block must be preceded by #
   [] If comment is longer than one line then the comment must be preceded by a
      line of hashes (80 char length)

   [] Code is complete, such that the script can be executed without additonal
      input.
   [] If there are special requirements to run this script (e.g. you have to
      install MUSIC), this must be explictly stated in the docstring.
