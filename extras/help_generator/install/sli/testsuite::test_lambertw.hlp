Name: testsuite::test_lambertw - check if lambertw function works

Synopsis:

(test_lambertw) run -> some known relations


Description:

The script tests whether the Lambert W-function [1] provided by the 
GNU Scientific Library (GSL) [2] fulfills some known relations [3]. 
In the absence of the GSL NEST uses a simple iterative scheme to 
compute the Lambert-W function. In this case we apply less strict 
criteria for the required accuracy. 
The relationships tested are: 
(1) the principal branch crosses the origin 
(2) at -1/e both branches meet athe value W=-1 
(3) the principal branch fulfills the "golden ratio" of exponentials 
(4) the non-principal branch yields the same result as we find by 
bisectioning for the problem given as an example in the documentation 
of LambertWm1 with realistic parameters.
