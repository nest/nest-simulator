Recording backend `sionlib` - Store data to an efficient binary format
######################################################################

Description
+++++++++++

.. admonition:: Availability

   This recording backend is only available if NEST was compiled with
   :ref:`support for MPI and SIONlib <compile-with-mpi>`.

The `sionlib` recording backend writes collected data persistently to
a binary container file (or to a rather small set of such files). This
is especially useful for large-scale simulations running in a
distributed way on many MPI processes/OpenMP threads. In such usage
scenarios, writing to plain text files (see :doc:`recording backend
for ASCII files <recording_backend_ascii>`) would cause a large
overhead because of the huge number of generated files and thus be
very inefficient.

The implementation of the `sionlib` backend is based on the `SIONlib
library <http://www.fz-juelich.de/jsc/sionlib>`_. Depending on the I/O
architecture of the compute cluster or supercomputer and the global
settings of the `sionlib` recording backend, either a single container
file or a set of these files is created. In case of a single file, it
is named according to the following pattern:

::

   <data_path>/<data_prefix><filename>

In case of multiple files, this name is extended for each file by a
dot followed by a consecutive number. The properties ``data_path`` and
``data_prefix`` are global kernel properties. They can for example be
set during repetitive simulation protocols to separate the data
originating from individual runs.

The life of a set of associated container files starts with the call
to ``Prepare`` and ends with the call to ``Cleanup``. Data that is
produced during successive calls to ``Run`` in between a pair of
``Prepare`` and ``Cleanup`` calls will be written to the same file
set. When creating a new recording, if the filename already exists,
the ``Prepare`` call will fail with a corresponding error message. To
instead overwrite the old file set, the kernel property
``overwrite_files`` can be set to ``True`` using the corresponding kernel
attribute. An alternative way for avoiding name clashes is to set the
kernel attributes ``data_path`` or ``data_prefix``, to write to a different file.

Data format
+++++++++++

In contrast to other recording backends, the ``sionlib`` backend
writes the data from all recorders using it to a single container
file(s). The file(s) contain the data in a custom binary format, which
is composed of a series of blocks in the following order:

* The *body block* contains the actual data records; the layout of an
  individual record depends on the type of the device and is described
  by a corresponding entry in the *device info block*

* The *file info block* keeps the file's metadata, like version
  information and such

* The *device info block* stores the properties and a data layout
  description for each device that uses the ``sionlib`` backend

* The *tail block* contains pointers to the *file info block*

The data layout of the NEST SIONlib file format v2 is shown in the
following figure.

Reading the data
++++++++++++++++

As the binary format of the files produced by the ``sionlib`` does not
conform to any standard, parsing them manually might be a bit
cumbersome. To ease this task, we provide a reader module for Python
that makes the files available in a convenient way. The source code
and further documentation for this module can be found in its own
`repository <https://github.com/nest/nest-sionlib-reader>`_.

Recorder-specific parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

label
    A recorder-specific string (default: *""*) that serves as alias
    name for the recording device, and which is stored in the metadata
    section of the container files.

Global parameters
+++++++++++++++++

These parameters can be set by assigning a nested dictionary to the
kernel attribute ``recording_backends``. The dictionary has to have
the form ``{'sionlib': {k_1: v_1, â€¦, k_n: v_n}`` with ``k_i`` being
from the following list:

filename
    The filename (default: *"output.sion"*) part of the pattern
    according to which the full filename (incl. path) is generated (see
    above).

sion_n_files
    The number of container files (default: *1*) used for storing the
    results of a single call to ``Simulate`` (or of a single
    ``Prepare``-``Run``-``Cleanup`` cycle). The default is one
    file. Using multiple files may have a performance advantage on
    large computing clusters, depending on how the (parallel) file
    system is accessed from the compute nodes.

sion_chunksize
    In SIONlib nomenclature, a single OpenMP thread running on a single
    MPI process is called a task. For each task, a specific number of
    bytes is allocated in the container file(s) from the
    beginning. This number is set by the parameter ``sion_chunksize``
    (default: *262144*). If the number of bytes written by each task
    during the simulation is known in advance, it is advantageous to
    set the chunk size to this value. In this way, the size of the
    container files has not to be adjusted by SIONlib during the
    simulation. This yields a slight performance advantage.  Choosing a
    value for ``sion_chunksize`` which is too large does not hurt that
    much because SIONlib container files are sparse files (if supported
    by the underlying file system) which only use up the disk space
    which is actually required by the stored data.

buffer_size
    The size of task-specific buffers (default: *1024*) within the
    `sionlib` recording backend in bytes.  These buffers are used to
    temporarily store data generated by the recording devices on each
    task. As soon as a buffer is full, its contents are written to the
    respective container file. To achieve optimum performance, the size
    of these buffers should at least amount to the size of the file
    system blocks.

sion_collective
    Flag (default: *false*) to enable the collective mode of
    SIONlib. In collective mode, recorded data is buffered completely
    during ``Run`` and only written at the very end of ``Run`` to the
    container files, all tasks acting synchronously. Furthermore,
    within SIONlib so-called collectors aggregate data from a specific
    number of tasks, and actually only these collectors directly access
    the container files, in this way minimizing load on the file
    system. The number of tasks per collector is determined
    automatically by SIONlib. However, collector size can also be set
    explicitly by the user via the environment variable SION_COLLSIZE
    before the start of NEST. On large simulations which also generate
    a large amount of data, collective mode can offer a performance
    advantage.
