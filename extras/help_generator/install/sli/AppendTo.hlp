Name: AppendTo - Append an object to a container

Synopsis:

any literal AppendTo -> --


Examples:

/j [4 5] def  7 /j AppendTo j --> [4 5 7]


Description:

Assignment like AddTo. Compared to Mathematica the order of 
arguments is reversed here, because its more readable to 
have the l-value close to the assignment operator, 
like in ... // Set[x,#]& . 
Allows for optimization of code.
