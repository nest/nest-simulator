<b>Description: </b>
<pre> <br/>   <br/>     pp_psc_delta is an implementation of a leaky integrator, where the potential  <br/>     jumps on each spike arrival. It produces spike stochastically, and supports  <br/>     spike-frequency adaptation, and other optional features.  <br/>   <br/>     Spikes are generated randomly according to the current value of the  <br/>     transfer function which operates on the membrane potential. Spike  <br/>     generation is followed by an optional dead time. Setting with_reset to  <br/>     true will reset the membrane potential after each spike.  <br/>   <br/>     The transfer function can be chosen to be linear, exponential or a sum of  <br/>     both by adjusting three parameters:  <br/>   <br/>         rate = Rect[ c_1 * V' + c_2 * exp(c_3 * V') ],  <br/>   <br/>     where the effective potential V' = V_m - E_sfa and E_sfa is called  <br/>     the adaptive threshold. Here Rect means rectifier:  <br/>     Rect(x) = {x if x>=0, 0 else} (this is necessary because negative rates are  <br/>     not possible).  <br/>   <br/>     By setting c_3 = 0, c_2 can be used as an offset spike rate for an otherwise  <br/>     linear rate model.  <br/>   <br/>     The dead time enables to include refractoriness. If dead time is 0, the  <br/>     number of spikes in one time step might exceed one and is drawn from the  <br/>     Poisson distribution accordingly. Otherwise, the probability for a spike  <br/>     is given by 1 - exp(-rate*h), where h is the simulation time step. If  <br/>     dead_time is smaller than the simulation resolution (time step), it is  <br/>     internally set to the resolution.  <br/>   <br/>     Note that, even if non-refractory neurons are to be modeled, a small value  <br/>     of dead_time, like dead_time=1e-8, might be the value of choice since it  <br/>     uses faster uniform random numbers than dead_time=0, which draws Poisson  <br/>     numbers. Only for very large spike rates (> 1 spike/time_step) this will  <br/>     cause errors.  <br/>   <br/>     The model can optionally include an adaptive firing threshold.  <br/>     If the neuron spikes, the threshold increases and the membrane potential  <br/>     will take longer to reach it.  <br/>     Here this is implemented by subtracting the value of the adaptive threshold  <br/>     E_sfa from the membrane potential V_m before passing the potential to the  <br/>     transfer function, see also above. E_sfa jumps by q_sfa when the neuron  <br/>     fires a spike, and decays exponentially with the time constant tau_sfa  <br/>     after (see [2] or [3]). Thus, the E_sfa corresponds to the convolution of the  <br/>     neuron's spike train with an exponential kernel.  <br/>     This adaptation kernel may also be chosen as the sum of n exponential  <br/>     kernels. To use this feature, q_sfa and tau_sfa have to be given as a list  <br/>     of n values each.  <br/>   <br/>     The firing of pp_psc_delta is usually not a renewal process. For example,  <br/>     its firing may depend on its past spikes if it has non-zero adaptation terms  <br/>     (q_sfa). But if so, it will depend on all its previous spikes, not just the  <br/>     last one -- so it is not a renewal process model. However, if "with_reset"  <br/>     is True, and all adaptation terms (q_sfa) are 0, then it will reset  <br/>     ("forget") its membrane potential each time a spike is emitted, which makes  <br/>     it a renewal process model (where "rate" above is its hazard function,  <br/>     also known as conditional intensity).  <br/>   <br/>     pp_psc_delta may also be called a spike-response model with escape-noise [6]  <br/>     (for vanishing, non-random dead_time). If c_1>0 and c_2==0, the rate is a  <br/>     convolution of the inputs with exponential filters -- which is a model known  <br/>     as a Hawkes point process (see [4]). If instead c_1==0, then pp_psc_delta is  <br/>     a point process generalized linear model (with the canonical link function,  <br/>     and exponential input filters) (see [5,6]).  <br/>   <br/>     This model has been adapted from iaf_psc_delta. The default parameters are  <br/>     set to the mean values given in [2], which have been matched to spike-train  <br/>     recordings. Due to the many features of pp_psc_delta and its versatility,  <br/>     parameters should be set carefully and conciously.  <br/>   <br/>   <br/>
