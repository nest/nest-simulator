Name: testsuite::test_spike_dilutor - test of spike_dilutor functionality

Synopsis: (test_spike_dilutor) run -> count the average number of spikes repeated by the spike dilutor

Description:
100 spikes are given to spike_dilutor and it has to repeat 20% of them (20 spikes) to 10 different spike detectors.
If the average number of spikes detected by spike detectors equals to 20 (with marginal error 3), the dilutor works fine.
