We provide a docker container for NEST that also includes NESTML. You can select from options
to also include NEST-Desktop, Jupyter Notebooks, or JupyterLab.

We provide an OVA live media format that can work in virtual machines (like Virtualbox).
See the :ref:`live media install instructions here <live_media>`

Alternatively, you can check out the `Comp-Neuro Fedora Project <https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro/>`_.
They provide an image of many computational neuroscience tools including NEST!

.. note::

  NEST developers do not officially support the Comp-Neuro Fedora Project. Questions and issues regarding the image from
  Comp-Neuro Fedora should be directed to that community.
