/** @BeginDocumentation
    Name: testsuite::test_multiple_synapses - Test that Connect with list of synapse dictionaries use the 
                                              correct values when connecting

    Synopsis: (test_multiple_synapses) run -> - 

    Description:
    test_multiple_synapses.sli checks that when Connect is given a list of synapse dictionaries, the given
    values are used when we have more than one process.
