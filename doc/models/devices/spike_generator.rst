**Name:**
::

    spike_generator - A device which generates spikes from an array with  
      spike-times.

**Synopsis:**
::

    spike_generator Create -> gid  
       
      

**Description:**
::

     
      A spike generator can be used to generate spikes at specific times  
      which are given to the spike generator as an array.  
       
      Spike times are given in milliseconds, and must be sorted with the  
      earliest spike first. All spike times must be strictly in the future.  
      Trying to set a spike time in the past or at the current time step,  
      will cause a NEST error. Setting a spike time of 0.0 will also result  
      in an error.  
       
      Spike times may not coincide with a time step, i.e., are not a multiple  
      of the simulation resolution. Three options control how spike times that  
      do not coincide with a step are handled (see examples below):  
       
      Multiple occurences of the same time indicate that more than one  
      event is to be generated at this particular time.  
       
      Additionally, spike_weights can be set. This also is an array,  
      which contains one weight value per spike time. If set, the spikes  
      are delivered with the respective weight multiplied with the  
      weight of the connection. To disable this functionality, the  
      spike_weights array can be set to an empty array.  
       
      /precise_times   default: false  
      If false, spike times will be rounded to simulation steps, i.e., multiples  
      of the resolution. The rounding is controlled by the two other flags.  
      If true, spike times will not be rounded but represented exactly as a  
      combination of step and offset. This should only be used if all neurons  
      receiving the spike train can handle precise timing information. In this  
      case, the other two options are ignored.  
       
      /allow_offgrid_times   default: false  
      If false, spike times will be rounded to the nearest step if they are  
      less than tic/2 from the step, otherwise NEST reports an error.  
      If true, spike times are rounded to the nearest step if within tic/2  
      from the step, otherwise they are rounded up to the *end* of the step.  
       
      /shift_now_spikes   default: false  
      This option is mainly for use by the PyNN-NEST interface.  
      If false, spike times rounded down to the current point in time will  
      be considered in the past and ignored.  
      If true, spike times that are rounded down to the current time step  
      are shifted one time step into the future.  
       
      Note that GetStatus will report the spike times that the spike_generator  
      will actually use, i.e., for grid-based simulation the spike times rounded  
      to the appropriate point on the time grid. This means that GetStatus may  
      return different /spike_times values at different resolutions.  
       
      Example:  
      spikegenerator << /spike_times [1.0 2.0 3.0] >> SetStatus  
       
      Instructs the spike generator to generate events at 1.0, 2.0, and  
      3.0 milliseconds, relative to the device-timer origin.  
       
      Example:  
      Assume that NEST works with default resolution (step size) of 0.1ms  
      and default tic length of 0.001ms. Then, spikes times not falling  
      onto the grid will be handled as follows for different option settings:  
       
      /spike_generator << /spike_times [1.0 1.9999 3.0001] >> Create  
      ---> spikes at steps 10 (==1.0ms), 20 (==2.0ms) and 30 (==3.0ms)  
       
      /spike_generator << /spike_times [1.0 1.05 3.0001] >> Create  
      ---> error, spike time 1.05 not within tic/2 of step  
       
      /spike_generator << /spike_times [1.0 1.05 3.0001]  
      /allow_offgrid_times true >> Create  
      ---> spikes at steps 10, 11 (mid-step time rounded up),  
      30 (time within tic/2 of step moved to step)  
       
      /spike_generator << /spike_times [1.0 1.05 3.0001]  
      /precise_times true >> Create  
      ---> spikes at step 10, offset 0.0; step 11, offset -0.05;  
      step 31, offset -0.0999  
       
      Assume we have simulated 10.0ms and simulation times is thus 10.0 (step 100).  
      Then, any spike times set, at this time, must be later than step 100.  
       
      /spike_generator << /spike_times [10.0001] >> Create  
      ---> spike time is within tic/2 of step 100, rounded down to 100 thus  
      not in the future, spike will not be emitted  
       
      /spike_generator << /spike_times [10.0001] /precise_times true >> Create  
      ---> spike at step 101, offset -0.0999 is in the future  
       
      /spike_generator  
      << /spike_times [10.0001 11.0001] /shift_now_spikes true >>  
      Create  
      ---> spike at step 101, spike shifted into the future, and spike at step 110,  
      not shifted, since it is in the future anyways  
       
       
      Example:  
      spikegenerator  
      << /spike_times [1.0 2.0] /spike_weights [5.0 -8.0] >>  
      SetStatus  
       
      Instructs the spike generator to generate an event with weight 5.0  
      at 1.0 ms, and an event with weight -8.0 at 2.0 ms, relative to  
      the device-timer origin.  
       
      spikegenerator << /spike_weights [] >> SetStatus  
       
      Instructs the spike generator to generate events at 1.0, 2.0, and  
      3.0 milliseconds, and use the weight of the connection.
