Name: testsuite::test_iaf_dc - sli script for test of iaf_psc_alpha with external DC current

Synopsis: (test_iaf_dc) run -> compare cout with comments in file


Description:

 test_iaf_dc.sli is a test of a specific feature of the iaf_psc_alpha
 model. It is tested at which time and how an external DC current affects 
 the state of the neuron, the membrane potential in particular.

 This is probably the simplest setup demonstrating how an external
 continuous function (the DC) can be incorporated into a system with
 point event interaction. A general introduction, including examples
 not restricted to piecewise constant functions, can be found in [1].

 The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
 the script.

 Cleary, the result of this script is not resolution independent. The 
 choice of the computation step size determines at which point in time 
 the current affects the neuron. 

 There are 2 problems with this script:
  1. A network element (here the DC generator) can only change its state
     when it performs a computation (update) step t -> t + h.
     Thus, the earliest possible time the DC generator can be switched on
     is at t=h. This is the default. Therefore, the time of onset depends
     on the computation step size.
  2. The default delay between the DC generator and the neuron is the minimal
     allowed value of 1 h. Therefore, the delay of the current depends on
     the computation step size.

 A sequence of further test scripts (SeeAlso key below) demonstrates and 
 verifies how the SLI script can be made independent of the computation 
 step size. This leads to properly aligned and identical voltage traces 
 for simulations carried out with different computation step sizes.
