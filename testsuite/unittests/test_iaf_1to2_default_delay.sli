Name: testsuite::test_iaf_1to2 - sli script for test of iaf_psc_alpha spike interaction

Synopsis: (test_iaf_1to2) run -> compare response with reference data

Description:

 test_iaf_1to2 checks the spike interaction of two iaf_psc_alpha model
 neurons.

 In order to obtain identical results for different computation step
 sizes h, the SLI script needs to be independent of h.  This is
 achieved by specifying all time parameters in milliseconds (ms). In
 particular the time of spike emission and the synaptic delay need to
 be integer multiples of the computation step sizes to be
 tested. test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay demonstrates the strategy for the
 case of DC current input.

 A DC current in the pre-synaptic neuron is adjusted to cause a spike
 at a grid position (t=3.0 ms) joined by all computation step sizes to
 be tested.
 
 Note that in a neuron model where synaptic events are modeled by a
 truncated exponential the effect of the incoming spike would be
 visible at the time of impact (here, t=4.0 ms). This is because the
 initial condition for the post-synaptic potential (PSP) has a
 non-zero voltage component. For PSPs with finite rise time the
 situation is different. In this case the voltage component of the
 initial condition is zero (see documentation of
 test_iaf_psp). Therefore, at the time of impact the PSP is only
 visible in other components of the state vector.

 The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of
 the script.
