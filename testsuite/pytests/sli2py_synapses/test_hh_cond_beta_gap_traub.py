"""
test_hh_cond_beta_gap_traub.sli is an overall test of the hh_cond_beta_gap_traub model connected
by gap_junction connection.

Two neurons of whom one receives an constant input current of 200 pA are connected
by gap_junction with an (unrealistic) high gap weight. The accurate functionality
of the gap_junction feature is tested by measuring the membrane potential of the
neuron without input current.

Although 0.1 cannot be represented in the IEEE double data type, it
is safe to simulate with a resolution (computation step size) of 0.1
ms because by default nest is built with a timebase enabling exact
representation of 0.1 ms.

The expected output is documented at the end of
the script. The textual output of the voltmeter documented in this file
can be regenerated by setting adding /to_screen true to the SetStatus
call of vm below.
