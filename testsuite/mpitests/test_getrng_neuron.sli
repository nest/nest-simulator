/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_getrng_neuron - sli script of assignment of rng to neuron

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_getrng_neuron.sli -> compare results for different numbers of jobs 

Description:

The scripts test whether in simulations distributed over different numbers of 
processors the assignment of the global id and the random number generator stay
the same.
See #336 for discussion.
