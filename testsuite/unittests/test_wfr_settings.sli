    Name: testsuite::test_wfr_settings - Tests the possible settings for the waveform relaxation method

    Synopsis: (test_wfr_settings) run -> NEST exits if test fails

    Description:
    The waveform relaxation method is used for iterative solution when connections
    without delay are present (e.g. gap junctions)
    
    This test ensures that 
    - use_wfr can only be set before nodes are created
    - wfr_comm_interval can only be set greater or equal the resolution and if use_wfr = true
    - setting of use_wfr = false sets wfr_comm_interval to resolution
    - wfr_comm_interval is updated when resolution is changed and use_wfr = false
    - use_wfr is set correctly in created nodes
