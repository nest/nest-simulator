    Synchronization Behavior

    The SLI code in this file reproduces the spike synchronization
    behavior of integrate-and-fire neurons in response to a subthreshold
    oscillation. This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 1 of

        C.D. Brody and J.J. Hopfield
        Simple Networks for Spike-Timing-Based Computation,
        with Application to Olfactory Processing
        Neuron 37, 843-852 (2003)

    Neurons receive a weak 35Hz oscillation, a gaussian noise current
    and an increasing DC. The time-locking capability is shown to
    depend on the input current given.
    All parameters are taken from the above paper.
