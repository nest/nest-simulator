    Helper function to simulate and check if neuron voltages exceed the reference.

    This function creates two neurons using the specified model and sets their initial voltage to Vref.
    It then simulates a network with a poisson generator, voltmeters, and the specified synapses.

    Args:
        model (str): The neuron model to use.
        syn1 (str): The first synapse model to connect the poisson generator to the first neuron.
        syn2 (str): The second synapse model to connect the poisson generator to the second neuron.
        debugging (bool): If True, prints additional information about the simulation results.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the maximum voltage of both neurons exceeds Vref, False otherwise.

    Ensure that poisson_generator_ps delivers spikes to more than one node.

    This test checks if a poisson generator can correctly deliver spikes to multiple neurons

    The test expects exceptions when mixed synapse models are used inappropriately.
