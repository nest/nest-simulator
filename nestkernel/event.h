/**
 * Encapsulates information which is sent between Nodes.
 *
 * For each type of information there has to be a specialized event
 * class.
 *
 * Events are used for two tasks. During connection, they are used as
 * polymorphic connect objects. During simulation they are used to
 * transport basic event information from one node to the other.
 *
 * A connection between two elements is physically established in two
 * steps: First, create an event with the two envolved elements.
 * Second, call the connect method of the event.
 *
 * An event object contains only administrative information which is
 * needed to successfully deliver the event. Thus, event objects
 * cannot direcly contain custom data: events are not messages. If a
 * node receives an event, arbitrary abounts of data may be exchanged
 * between the participating nodes.

 * With this restriction it is possible to implement a comparatively
 * efficient event handling scheme. 5-6 function calls per event may
 * seem a long time, but this is cheap if we consider that event
 * handling makes update and communication succeptible to parallel
 * execution.
