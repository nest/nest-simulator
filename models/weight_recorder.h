Name: weight_recorder - Device for detecting single spikes.

Description:
The weight_recorder device is a recording device. It is used to record
weights from synapses. Data is recorded in memory or to file as for all
RecordingDevices.
By default, source GID, target GID, time and weight of each spike is recorded.

In order to record only from a subset of connected synapses, the
weight_recorder accepts the parameters 'senders' and 'targets', with which the
recorded data is limited to the synapses with the corresponding source or target
gid.

The weight recorder can also record weights with full precision
from neurons emitting precisely timed spikes. Set /precise_times to
achieve this.

Data is not necessarily written to file in chronological order.

Receives: WeightRecordingEvent
