Name: testsuite::ticket-564 - Regression test for OpenMP-parallel problems on OSX

Synopsis: (ticket-564) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description: 
This test uses Connect to connect a net of 100 neurons
to itself, with 100 connections per neuron, a total of 10000 connections.
This is repeated 10 times, and the resulting number of connections checked.
