Name: testsuite::test_gsd_FixedTotalNumber - Test global spike detector with MPI

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_gsd_FixedTotalNumber.sli -> -

Description:
This scripts tests the 'fixed_total_number' connection rule in combination
with the gsd spike detector scheme. A network is created on 2 MPI
processes with 0 recording procs and on 3 MPI procs with 1 recording
proc. The script should yield the very same connections for both cases.
