"""Script to check if all defined Name objects are actually used.

In particular, this script checks first if all static Name objects
declared in the *_names.h header files (see variable names_files
below) are also declared in the corresponding implementation files and
second if they are actually used somewhere in the code. It uses the
variable NEST_SOURCES to determine the source directory to check.

This script is supposed to be run from static_code_analysis.sh either
during the run of the CI or invocation of check_code_style.sh.

In order to ease error reporting in this context, this script uses two
distinct output channels: messages meant for immediate display are
printed to stderr using the helper function eprint(). Messages meant
for the summary at the end of static_code_analysis.sh are printed to
stdout instead so they can be more easily captured and only printed if
errors occurred.
