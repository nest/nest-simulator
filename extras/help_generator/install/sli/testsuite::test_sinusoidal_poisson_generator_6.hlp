Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_poisson_generator_6 - Test parallel generation of sinusoidally modulate Poissonian trains with individual spike trains

Synopsis:

nest_indirect test_sinusoidal_poisson_generator_6.sli ->	-


Description:

Creates a sinusoidally modulated Poisson generator emitting an 
individual spike train to each of its targets and sends spikes to spike 
detectors. Ensures that all targets receive identical spike trains. 
NOTE: THIS TEST DOES NOT WORK AUTOMATICALLY, DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH UNITTEST. 
You can run it manually and see if the output is as expected with 
mpirun -np 2 nest test_sinusoidal_poisson_generator_6.sli
