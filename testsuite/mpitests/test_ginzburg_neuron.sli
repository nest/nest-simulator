 /** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_ginzburg_neuron - Test parallel generation of Poissonian trains

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_ginzburg_neuron.sli -> -

Description:
   Creates ginzburg neurons and sends spikes to spike detector. Assert invariant
   results for fixed VP number. This is a partial response to #551. May be adapted
   to other generators.

Author:  December 2012, Plesser, based on test_poisson_generator.sli
