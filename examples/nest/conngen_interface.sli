% This example shows how to use the Connection Generator Interface of
% libneurosim ([1]) from the SLI level. It connects two small neuronal
% populations using a connection pattern specified in the XML notation
% of the the Connection Set Algebra (CSA, [2]). The example relies on
% the C++ implementation of the CSA ([3]). At the time of writing, this
% implementation is not publically available and the example itself is
% thus a bit pointless. It is left here for future reference.
