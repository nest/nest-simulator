Comparing precise and grid-based neuron models
----------------------------------------------

In traditional time-driven simulations, spikes are constrained to the
time grid at a user-defined resolution. The precise spiking models
overcome this by handling spikes in continuous time [1]_ and [2]_.

The precise spiking neuron models in NEST include: ``iaf_psc_exp_ps``,
``iaf_psc_alpha_ps`` and ``iaf_psc_delta_ps``.
More detailed information about the precise spiking models can be
found here:
https://www.nest-simulator.org/simulations-with-precise-spike-times/

This example compares the conventional grid-constrained model and the
precise version for an integrate-and-fire neuron model with exponential
postsynaptic currents [2]_.
