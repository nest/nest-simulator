Name: testsuite::test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay - sli script for test of iaf_neuron resolution independence

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay) run -> compare response with reference data


Description:

test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay.sli is a modified version of 
test_iaf_dc_aligned. The output generated by the former is exactly 
identical to the output of the latter. However, the  dependence of the 
simulation script on the computation step size is fully removed by 
replacing the default value of the delay between DC generator and 
neuron by a value specified in ms and larger than the largest 
computation step size to be used in the simulation. Note that the 
specification of the delay is now independent of the computation step 
size. 
In addition, variables are introduced to clarify the meaning of 
of various time measures and a few relationships are tested. 
The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
the script. 
The intention of this script is that the current starts to affect the 
neuron (is present from) at time t=3ms (dc_visible). With a delay of 
1ms (dc_delay), the time stamp of the emitted current event (dc_on) 
needs to be dc_visible	- dc_delay. Thus, according to the definitions 
of the timing scheme, the emission time of the DC generator (start) 
needs to be dc_visible	- dc_delay.


Remarks:

In earlier versions, the file 
test_iaf_dc_aligned_automatic.sli 
contained a further improved version of this script. Here, /start 
specified the activation time t of the device not the time stamp t+h 
of the first event that can be emitted. An additional property /on 
was required to make the SLI code independent of the resolution. The 
device carried out the transformation start = on	- h (see also 
test_iaf_dc_aligned.sli).  Now the code in 
test_iaf_dc_aligned_automatic.sli is identical to the code in this 
file.
