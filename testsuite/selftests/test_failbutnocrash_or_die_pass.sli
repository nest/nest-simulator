% At this point nest is serial 
% Therefore, we can now do the test.


% the following call shall pass without error
{ 1 0 div } failbutnocrash_or_die

% the following shall make NEST exit with exit code 3 (code did not fail)
{ 1 0 add } failbutnocrash_or_die

% Test that procedure handles crash correctly in ..._crash.sli, cannot run more 
% tests here because NEST terminates on line above if all goes well.
