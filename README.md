NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the
dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact
morphology of individual neurons. The development of NEST is coordinated by the
NEST Initiative.

A NEST simulation tries to follow the logic of an electrophysiological
experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference, that the
neural system to be investigated must be defined by the experimenter.

NEST is ideal for networks of spiking neurons of any size, for example:

- Models of information processing e.g. in the visual or auditory cortex of
  mammals,
- Models of network activity dynamics, e.g. laminar cortical networks or
  balanced random networks,
- Models of learning and plasticity.

## Key features of NEST

* NEST provides a Python interface or stand alone application
* NEST provides a large collection of neurons and synapse models
* NEST provides numerous example network scripts along with tutorials and guides to help you
  develop your simulation.
* NEST has a large community of experienced developers and users. NEST was first released in 1994 under the name SYNOD, and has been extended and improved ever since.
* NEST is extensible: you can extend NEST by adding your own modules
* NEST is scalable: Use NEST on your laptop or the largest supercomputers
* NEST is memory efficient: It makes best use of your multi-core computer and compute clusters with minimal user intervention.
* NEST is ian open source project and is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 or later.
* NEST employs continuous integration workflows in order to maintain high code quality standards for correct and reproducible simulations.
