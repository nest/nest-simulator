/** @BeginDocumentation

Name: testsuite::ticket-692 - ensure GetConnections checks its args

Synopsis: (ticket-686-positive-parameters) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
This tests ensures that models with parameters C_m or tau_* throw an exception
when trying to set a value that is not strictly positive.

The test also ensures that values can actually be set to different, positive
values.
