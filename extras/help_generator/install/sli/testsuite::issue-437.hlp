Name: testsuite::issue-437 - Ensure parameter passed in Connect are set

Synopsis:

(issue-437) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test makes sure that if parameter dictionaries are passed to 
Connect, the values are actually set. To avoid conflicts with synapse 
compatibility, we use labeled synapses and try setting the label.
