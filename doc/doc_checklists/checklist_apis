Checklist PyNEST APIs
======================

See https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html for details on the
NumPy Format of APIs

- Docstring (NumPy Style)

  	[] Use triple double quotes """ to demarcate docstring from rest of file
    [] Headings underlined with dashes (Ensure the dashes extend beyond text)
    [] reST directives should be separated from other text by new line
    [] Summary line describes purpose of function and function name or variable 
       names should be avoided, on same line as  """
    [] Variables, paths, functions and objects should be surrounded by double
       back ticks (e.g. ``var``) in paragraphs.
    [] The order of sections in the docstring: Summary line, extended summary (no
       heading), Parameters, Returns, Raises, Notes (optional), References, See
       Also, KEYWORDS)
    [] All functions should have a docstring with at least a summary line

- Extended Summary Section versus Notes section

    [] Below summary line (separated by new line), there should be an extended
       summary section that should be used to clarify functionality.
    [] Further explanations or mathematical equations should be included in the 
       Notes section.

- Bibliography Format and Section

    [] In-text citations are formatted with reST format [1]_ (Note underscore).
    [] A section called References must be included if citation given.
       **Do not include** formatting marks (bold, italic, underline) in refs.
    [] Surname first for all authors, if more than 3 authors, use 'et al.'.
    [] Article title in sentence case, full name of journal in title case
    [] Year should follows authors
    [] Include DOI, if available

- Math Format

    [] Model equations should not be included in the APIs. But if some form
       of math is required, only include them in the Notes section.
    [] Equation in LaTeX format using reST math directive or math role

- See Also section

     [] The last section should be the See Also section that includes filenames of
        2 or 3 related functions or other related docs.

- Keywords

    [] The last item in docstring is KEYWORDS (written in allcaps with colon)
    [] Keywords are comma separated
    [] Keywords can be short phrases (like Integrate and Fire), and should
       include important terms.

- Additional comments

    [] # is used for comments explaining the code itself not how it's used

- Deprecation Warning

    [] Follows extended summary
    [] State in what NEST version the object was deprecated, and when it will be
       removed.
    [] Reason for deprecation if this is useful information (e.g., object is
       superseded, duplicates functionality found elsewhere, etc.).
    [] New recommended way of obtaining the same functionality.

- Returns, Raises sections

    [] Returns explains the returned values and their types. But type can be
       left out.
    [] Raises is an optional section detailing which errors get raised under
       what condition.
