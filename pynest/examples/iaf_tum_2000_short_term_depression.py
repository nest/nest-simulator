Short-term depression example
-----------------------------

The `iaf_tum_2000 <../models/iaf_tum_2000>` neuron [1]_ is a model with
*short-term synaptic plasticity*. Short-term plasticity can either strengthen
or weaken a synapse and acts on a timescale of milliseconds to seconds. This
example illustrates *short-term depression*, which is caused by depletion of
the pool of readily releasable neurotransmitters at the axon terminal of a
presynaptic neuron when many presynaptic spikes occur in rapid succession.
During synaptic depression, the strength of the synapse declines until this
pool can be replenished.

In the ``iaf_tum_2000`` model, a fraction :math:`u` of the available synaptic
resources :math:`x` is used by each presynaptic spike (see Eq. 3 and 4 or
Eq. 2.1 and 2.2 in [1]_ or [2]_, respectively). A parameter :math:`U \in [0, 1]`
determines the increase in :math:`u` with each spike.

In this example, we reproduce Figure 1A in [2]_. We connect two
``iaf_tum_2000`` neurons. The presynaptic neuron is driven by DC input and
we record the voltage trace of the postsynaptic neuron. Short-term depression
is enabled by setting :math:`U` to a large value, which causes a fast saturation
of the synaptic efficacy.

For an example on *short-term facilitation*, see
:doc:`../auto_examples/iaf_tum_2000_short_term_facilitation`.

.. note::

    The `iaf_tum_2000 <../models/iaf_tum_2000>` neuron model combined with
    `static_synapse <../models/static_synapse>` provides a more efficient
    implementation of the model studied in [1]_ and [2]_ than the combination
    of `iaf_psc_exp <../models/iaf_psc_exp>` with
    `tsodyks_synapse <../models/tsodyks_synapse>`.
