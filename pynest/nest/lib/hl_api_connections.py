def Disconnect(*args, conn_spec=None, syn_spec=None):

    When specifying `pre` and `post` nodes, they are disconnected using the specified disconnection
    rule (one-to-one by default) and synapse type (:cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::static_synapse>` by default).
    Details depend on the disconnection rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : SynapseCollection or NodeCollections
        Either a collection of connections to disconnect, or pre- and postsynaptic nodes given as NodeCollections
    conn_spec : str or dict
        Disconnection rule when specifying pre- and postsynaptic nodes, see below
    syn_spec : str or dict
        Synapse specifications when specifying pre- and postsynaptic nodes, see below

    Notes
    -------

    **conn_spec**

    Apply the same rules as for connectivity specs in the :py:func:`.Connect` method

    Possible choices of the conn_spec are

    - 'one_to_one'
    - 'all_to_all'

    **syn_spec**

    The synapse model and its properties can be specified either as a string naming
    a synapse model (the list of all available synapse models can be gotten via
    ``nest.synapse_models``) or as a dictionary as described below.

    Note that only the synapse type is checked when we disconnect and that if
    `syn_spec` is given as a non-empty dictionary, the 'synapse_model' parameter must
    be present.

    If no synapse model is specified the default model
    :cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::static_synapse>` will be used.

    Available keys in the synapse dictionary are:
    ::

    - 'synapse_model'
    - 'weight'
    - 'delay',
    - 'receptor_type'
    - parameters specific to the synapse model chosen

    'synapse_model' determines the synapse type, taken from pre-defined synapse
    types in NEST or manually specified synapses created via :py:func:`.CopyModel`.

    All other parameters are not currently implemented.

    Notes
    -----
    `Disconnect` only disconnects explicitly specified nodes.
