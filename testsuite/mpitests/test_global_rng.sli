/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_global_rng - check whether global rng gives consistent results

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_global_rng.sli -> compare results for different numbers of jobs

Description:

The scripts test whether in simulations distributed over different numbers of
processors the global random number generator gives identical results on all
jobs and for different numbers of jobs. To draw numbers, GetValues is used on
a uniform parameter. This draws from the uniform distribution using the global
random number generator.
See #186 for discussion.
