Name: testsuite::test_iaf_i0_refractory - sli script for test of iaf_neuron internal DC current

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_i0_refractory) run -> compare cout with comments in file


Description:

test_iaf_i0_refractory.sli is a test of a specific feature of the 
iaf_neuron model. It is tested whether the voltage traces of simulations 
carried out at different resolutions (computation step sizes) are well 
aligned and identical when the neuron recovers from refractoriness. 
In grid based simulation a prerequisite is that the spike is reported at 
a grid position shared by all the resolutions compared. 
Here, we compare resolutions 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 ms. Therefore, the 
internal DC current is adjusted such (1450.0 pA) that the spike is 
reported at time 3.0 ms, corresponding to computation step 30, 15, 6, 
and 3, respectively. 
The results are consistent with those of iaf_neuron_ps capable of 
handling off-grid spike timing when the interpolation order is set to 
0. 
The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
the script. 
The file is an extended version of test_iaf_i0.sli .
