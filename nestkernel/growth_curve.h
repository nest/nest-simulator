  Name: growth_curve_linear - Linear version of a growth curve

  Description:
   This class represents a linear growth rule for the number of synaptic
   elements inside a neuron. The creation and deletion of synaptic elements
   when structural plasticity is enabled, allows the dynamic rewiring of the
   network during the simulation.
   This type of growth curve uses an exact integration method to update the
   number of synaptic elements: dz/dt = nu (1 - (1/eps) * Ca(t)), where nu is
   the growth rate [elements/ms] and eps is the desired average calcium
   concentration. The growth rate nu is defined in the SynapticElement class.

  Parameters:
   eps          double -  The target calcium concentration that
                          the neuron should look to achieve by creating or
                          deleting synaptic elements. It should always be a
                          positive value.  It is important to note that the
                          calcium concentration is linearly proportional to the
                          firing rate. This is because dCa/dt = - Ca(t)/tau_Ca
                          + beta_Ca if the neuron fires and dCa/dt = -
                          Ca(t)/tau_Ca otherwise, where tau_Ca is the calcium
                          concentration decay constant and beta_Ca is the
                          calcium intake constant (see SynapticElement class).
                          This means that eps also defines the desired firing
                          rate that the neuron should achieve.  For example, an
                          eps = 0.05 [Ca2+] with tau_Ca = 10000.0 and beta_Ca =
                          0.001 for a synaptic element means a desired firing
                          rate of 5Hz.

  Name: growth_curve_gaussian - Gaussian version of a growth curve

  Description:
   This class represents a Gaussian growth rule for the number of synaptic
   elements inside a neuron. The creation and deletion of synaptic elements
   when structural plasticity is enabled, allows the dynamic rewiring of the
   network during the simulation.
   This type of growth curve  uses a forward Euler integration method to update
   the number of synaptic elements:
   dz/dt = nu (2 * e^(- ((Ca(t) - xi)/z)^2 ) - 1)
   where xi = (eta  + eps)/2,
   zeta = (eps - eta)/2 * sqrt(ln(2))),
   eta is the minimum calcium concentration required for any synaptic element
   to be created, eps is the target mean calcium concentration in the neuron
   and nu is the growth rate in elements/ms. The growth rate nu is defined in
   the SynapticElement class.

  Parameters:
   eta          double -  Minimum amount of calcium concentration that the
                          neuron needs to start creating synaptic elements.
                          eta can have a negative value, making the growth
                          curve move its maximum to the left. For example, if
                          eta=-0.5 and eps=0.5 [Ca2+], the maximum growth rate
                          (elements/ms) will be achieved at 0.0 [Ca2+]. If
                          eta=0.0 [Ca2+] and eps=0.5 [Ca2+] the maximum growth
                          rate will be achieved at 0.25 [Ca2+] while at 0.0
                          [Ca+2] no new elements will be created.

   eps          double -  The target calcium concentration that
                          the neuron should look to achieve by creating or
                          deleting synaptic elements. It should always be a
                          positive value.  It is important to note that the
                          calcium concentration is linearly proportional to the
                          firing rate. This is because dCa/dt = - Ca(t)/tau_Ca
                          + beta_Ca if the neuron fires and dCa/dt = -
                          Ca(t)/tau_Ca otherwise, where tau_Ca is the calcium
                          concentration decay constant and beta_Ca is the
                          calcium intake constant (see SynapticElement class).
                          This means that eps can also be seen as the desired
                          firing rate that the neuron should achieve.  For
                          example, an eps = 0.05 [Ca2+] with tau_Ca = 10000.0
                          and beta_Ca = 0.001 for a synaptic element means a
                          desired firing rate of 5Hz.

   nu           double -  Growth rate in elements/ms. The growth rate nu is
                          defined in the SynapticElement class. Can be negative.
