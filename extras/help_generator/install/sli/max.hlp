Name: max - return the greater of two values

Synopsis:

val1 val2 max -> result


Examples:

1   2   max -> 2 
1   2.0 max -> 2.0 
1.0 2   max -> 2


Description:

This function returns the greater of two values, by removing the other 
one from the stack. Hence, the output type is the same as the 
respective input type (integer or double). 
Alternatives: Functions  max_i_i, max_i_d, max_d_i, max_d_d (all 
undocumented), where i is standing for integer and for double as 
arguments -> behaviour and synopsis are the same.


Parameters:

val1, val2: numeric values (integer or double) 
result   : the greater of the two values (keeping its type, integer 
or double)
