Short description

Generate spikes from an array with spike-times

Description
+++++++++++

A spike generator can be used to generate spikes at specific times
which are given to the spike generator as an array.

Spike times are given in milliseconds, and must be sorted with the
earliest spike first. All spike times must be strictly in the future.
Trying to set a spike time in the past or at the current time step
will cause a NEST error. Setting a spike time of 0.0 will also result
in an error.

Spike times may not coincide with a time step, i.e., are not a multiple
of the simulation resolution. Three options control how spike times that
do not coincide with a step are handled (see examples below):

Multiple occurrences of the same time indicate that more than one
event is to be generated at this particular time.

Additionally, `spike_weights` can be set. This is an array as well.
It contains one weight value per spike time. If set, the spikes
are delivered with the respective weight multiplied with the
weight of the connection. To disable this functionality, the
spike_weights array can be set to an empty array.

    `precise_times`  default: false

If false, spike times will be rounded to simulation steps, i.e., multiples
of the resolution. The rounding is controlled by the two other flags.
If true, spike times will not be rounded but represented exactly as a
combination of step and offset. This should only be used if all neurons
receiving the spike train can handle precise timing information. In this
case, the other two options are ignored.

    `allow_offgrid_times`   default: false

If false, spike times will be rounded to the nearest step if they are
less than tic/2 from the step, otherwise NEST reports an error.
If true, spike times are rounded to the nearest step if within tic/2
from the step, otherwise they are rounded up to the *end* of the step.

    `shift_now_spikes`   default: false

This option is mainly for use by the PyNN-NEST interface.
If false, spike times rounded down to the current point in time will
be considered in the past and ignored.
If true, spike times that are rounded down to the current time step
are shifted one time step into the future.

Note that ``GetStatus`` will report the spike times that the spike_generator
will actually use, i.e., for grid-based simulation the spike times rounded
to the appropriate point on the time grid. This means that ``GetStatus`` may
return different `spike_times` values at different resolutions.

Example:

  ::

     nest.Create("spike_generator",
                 params={"spike_times": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]})

  Instructs the spike generator to generate events at 1.0, 2.0, and
  3.0 milliseconds, relative to the device-timer origin.

Example:

Assume that NEST works with default resolution (step size) of 0.1 ms
and default tic length of 0.001 ms. Then, spikes times not falling
onto the grid will be handled as follows for different option settings:

  ::

    nest.Create("spike_generator",
               params={"spike_times": [1.0, 1.9999, 3.0001]})

  ---> spikes at steps 10 (==1.0 ms), 20 (==2.0 ms) and 30 (==3.0 ms)

  ::

    nest.Create("spike_generator",
               params={"spike_times": [1.0, 1.05, 3.0001]})

  ---> **Error!** Spike time 1.05 not within tic/2 of step


  ::

    nest.Create("spike_generator",
               params={"spike_times": [1.0, 1.05, 3.0001],
               "allow_offgrid_times": True})

  ---> spikes at steps 10, 11 (mid-step time rounded up),
         30 (time within tic/2 of step moved to step)

  ::

    nest.Create("spike_generator",
               params={"spike_times": [1.0, 1.05, 3.0001],
               "precise_times": True})

  ---> spikes at step 10, offset 0.0; step 11, offset -0.05;
         step 31, offset -0.0999

Assume we have simulated 10.0 ms and simulation time is thus 10.0 (step
100). Then, any spike times set at this time must be later than step 100.

  ::

    nest.Create("spike_generator",
               params={"spike_times": [10.0001]})

  ---> spike time is within tic/2 of step 100, rounded down to 100 thus
         not in the future; **spike will not be emitted**

  ::

    nest.Create("spike_generator",
               params={"spike_times": [10.0001],
               "precise_times": True})

  ---> spike at step 101, offset -0.0999 is in the future

  ::

    nest.Create("spike_generator",
               params={"spike_times": [10.0001, 11.0001],
               "shift_now_spikes": True})

  ---> spike at step 101, spike shifted into the future, and spike at step
        110, not shifted, since it is in the future anyways

Set spike times from a stimulation backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The spike times for this stimulation device can be updated with input
coming from a stimulation backend. The data structure used for the
update holds just an array of spike times in ms.
