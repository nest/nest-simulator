The aim\nis to find a firing rate for the inhibitory population that will make\nthe neuron fire at the same rate as the excitatory population.\n\nOptimization is performed using the ``bisection`` method from Scipy,\nsimulating the network repeatedly.\n\nThis example is also shown in the article [1]_\n\n## References\n\n..

It can also be called with a list of weights, as in the connection\nof the noise below.\nNote that the connection direction for the ``voltmeter`` is reversed compared\nto the ``spike_recorder``, because it observes the neuron instead of\nreceiving events from it.
