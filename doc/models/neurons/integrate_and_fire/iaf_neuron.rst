**Name:**
::

    iaf_neuron - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model.

**Description:**
::

     
       
      iaf_neuron is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model  
      with alpha-function shaped synaptic currents. Thus, synaptic currents  
      and the resulting post-synaptic potentials have a finite rise time.  
      The threshold crossing is followed by an absolute refractory period  
      during which the membrane potential is clamped to the resting potential.  
       
      The subthreshold membrane potential dynamics are given by [3]  
       
      dV_m/dt = - ( V_m - E_L ) / tau_m + I_syn(t) / C_m + I_e / C_m  
       
      where I_syn(t) is the sum of alpha-shaped synaptic currents  
       
      I_syn(t) = Sum[w_j alpha(t-t_j) for t_j in input spike times]  
       
      w_j is the synaptic weight of the connection through which the spike  
      at time t_j arrived. Each individual alpha-current is given by  
       
      alpha(t) = e * t/tau_s * e^{-t/tau_s} * Heaviside(t)  
       
      alpha(t=tau_s) == 1 is the maximum of the alpha-current.  
       
      The linear subthresold dynamics is integrated by the Exact  
      Integration scheme [1]. The neuron dynamics is solved on the time  
      grid given by the computation step size. Incoming as well as emitted  
      spikes are forced to that grid.  
       
      An additional state variable and the corresponding differential  
      equation represents a piecewise constant external current.  
       
      The general framework for the consistent formulation of systems with  
      neuron like dynamics interacting by point events is described in  
      [1].  A flow chart can be found in [2].  
       
      Critical tests for the formulation of the neuron model are the  
      comparisons of simulation results for different computation step  
      sizes. sli/testsuite/nest contains a number of such tests.  
       
      The iaf_neuron is the standard model used to check the consistency  
      of the nest simulation kernel because it is at the same time complex  
      enough to exhibit non-trivial dynamics and simple enough to compute  
      relevant measures analytically.

**Remarks:**
::

     
      If tau_m is very close to tau_syn, the model will numerically behave as if  
      tau_m is equal to tau_syn to avoid numerical instabilities.  
      For details, please see IAF_Neruons_Singularity.ipynb in  
      the NEST source code (docs/model_details).
