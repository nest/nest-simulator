/**
 * @note There are two data logger class templates. The UniversalDataLogger
 *       class template is connected and populated using a RecordablesMap
 *       instance. The DynamicUniversalDataLogger class templated is
 *       connected and populated using a DynamicRecordablesMap instance.
 *       Conceptually the difference is that neurons that have a
 *       RecordablesMap instance, have a static number of state variables
 *       that can be recorded, while neurons with DynamicRecordablesMap
 *       can vary the number of recordable state variables at runtime.
 *       This is the main feature of multisynapse neurons where the
 *       number of conductance channels can change at runtime, and thus
 *       the number of recordable variables also changes.
 *       The technical difference between the UniversalDataLogger and
 *       DynamicUniversalDataLogger is that the way in which the neuron's
 *       state is accessed is different. In the former class, the data is
 *       accessed using a call to a static function pointer stored in
 *       the neurons RecordablesMap. In the latter class, the data is
 *       accessed through a functor call that holds a reference to the
 *       neuron's id and the recorded state variable's index.

/**
 * Universal data-logging plug-in for neuron models.
 *
 * This class provides logging of universal data such as
 * membrane potentials or conductances in a way that is
 * compatible with the DataLoggingRequest/DataLoggingReply
 * read-out mechanism. It is intended to be used by neuron models
 * that have static recordable state variables, i.e. all models except
 * multisynapse models.
 *
 * The logger must be informed about any incoming DataLoggingRequest
 * connections by calling connect_logging_device(). All incoming
 * DataLoggingRequests should then be forwarded to the logger using
 * handle().
 *
 * @note A reference to the host node is stored in the logger, for
 *       access to the state and sending events. This requires a constructor
 *       and a copy constructor for the HostNode::Buffers_, creating new
 *       logger members initialized with the new node, e.g.
 * @code
 * struct Buffers_ {
 *   Buffers_(iaf_cond_alpha&);
 *   Buffers_(const Buffers_&, iaf_cond_alpha&);
 *
 *   UniversalDataLogger<iaf_cond_alpha> logger_;
 *
 * ...
 *
 * nest::iaf_cond_alpha::Buffers_::Buffers_(iaf_cond_alpha& n)
 * : logger_(n), ... {}
 *
 * nest::iaf_cond_alpha::Buffers_::Buffers_(const Buffers_&, iaf_cond_alpha& n)
 * : logger_(n), ... {}
 *
 * nest::iaf_cond_alpha::iaf_cond_alpha()
 * : ..., B_(*this) {}
 *
 * nest::iaf_cond_alpha::iaf_cond_alpha(const iaf_cond_alpha& n)
 * : ..., B_(n.B_, *this) {}
 * @code
 *
 * @todo Could HostNode be passed as const& to handle() and record_data()?
 *
 * @note To avoid inclusion problems and code-bloat, the class
 *       interface is defined in this file, while most of the
 *       implementation is in the companion universal_data_logger_impl.h.
 *       As a consequence, calls to UniversalDataLogger members should
 *       only come from cpp files---do not inline them.
