      The most common type of neuron model in NEST.
      Point neurons are simplified models of biological neurons that represent
      the neuron as a single point where all inputs are processed,
      without considering the complex neuronal morphology (such as dendrites and axons).

      Neurons are subdivided into multiple compartments that can represent different parts of the neuronal morphology,
      like soma, basal and apical dendrites. Inputs can be received in all compartments and are mediated across
      compartments via electric coupling.

      For more information see our project :doc:`NEST-NEAT <neat:index>`, a Python library for the study, simulation and
      simplification of morphological neuron models.

Spiking mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Spiking neuron models process synaptic inputs and generate discrete output events, which are called action
potentials or spikes.
The mechanisms by which these spikes are generated can be classified with the following distinctions.


Hard threshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      :columns: 2
      :class: sd-d-flex-row sd-align-major-center

        .. tab-item:: General info
          :selected:

          When the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold,
          the neuron deterministically  "fires" an action potential.
          Neuron models with hard threshold do not contain intrinsic dynamics that produce the upswing of a spike.
          Some of the neurons in this class do not reset the membrane potential after a spike.
          Note that the threshold itself can be dynamic (see `Adaptation` section below).



            .. dropdown:: Hard threshold

               {% for items in tag_dict %}

Soft threshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

          .. tab-item:: General info
            :selected:

            Neurons with a soft threshold model aspects of the voltage dependent conductances that underlie the
            biophysics of spike generation. Models either produce dynamics, which mimic the upswing of a spike or
            the whole spike wave form.
            Some models in this class contain a hard threshold that triggers an instantaneous reset of the membrane potential.
            This threshold is needed to finish the action potential and to avoid an unbounded growth of the membrane potential.
            The action-potential initiation is not affected by this and governed by continuous dynamics.

            .. dropdown:: Soft threshold

Stochastic
^^^^^^^^^^

      .. image::  /static/img/point_process_nn.svg

   .. grid-item::
      :columns: 10

      Stochastic spiking models do not produce deterministic spike events: instead spike times are stochastic and described
      by a point process, with an underlying time dependent firing rate that is determined by the membrane potential of a neuron.
      Elevated membrane potential with respect to the resting potential increaes the likelihood of output spikes.

      .. dropdown::  Stochastic

         {% for items in tag_dict %}
         {% if items.tag == "stochastic" %}

         {% endfor %}
         {% endif %}
         {% endfor %}


Input mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NEST supports various input mechanisms to neuron models. The majority of mechanisms are related to chemical synapses
that couple neurons with a delay, but there are also electrical synapses, which couple neurons instantaneously.

Electrical
^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Gap junctions <sim_gap_junctions>` are direct electrical connections between neurons. The respective membrane potentials are instantaneously
coupled to each other.

Chemical
^^^^^^^^

Chemical synapses couple neurons in a delayed fashion, because of the conversion of electrical and chemical
signals at the synapse. This process is captured by two major classes of models in NEST that either model synaptic
inputs as currents or conductances.



   **Current-based (CUBA) models**


   .. grid:: 1 2 2 2

      .. grid-item::
        :columns: 2
        :class: sd-d-flex-row sd-align-major-center

        .. image::  /static/img/current_based_nn.svg

      .. grid-item::
        :columns: 10


        Model post-synaptic responses to incoming spikes as changes in current.
        The response of the post-synaptic neuron is independent of the neuronal state.
        In NEST, current-based neuron models are labeled by ``psc`` (post-synaptic currents).

        .. dropdown:: Current-based neuron models

            {% for items in tag_dict %}
            {% if items.tag == "current-based" %}
            {% for item in items.models | sort %}
            * :doc:`/models/{{ item | replace(".html", "") }}`
            {% endfor %}
            {% endif %}
          {% endfor %}

   **Conductance-based (COBA) models**


   .. grid:: 1 2 2 2

      .. grid-item::
        :columns: 2
        :class: sd-d-flex-row sd-align-major-center

        .. image::  /static/img/conductance_based_nn.svg

      .. grid-item::
        :columns: 10

        Model post-synaptic responses to incoming spikes as changes in conductances.
        The response of the post-synaptic neuron depends on the neuronal state.
        These models capture more realistic synaptic behavior, as they account for the varying impact of
        synaptic inputs depending on the membrane potential, which can change over time.
        In NEST, conductance-based neuron models are labeled by ``cond``.


        .. dropdown:: Conductance-based neuron models

            {% for items in tag_dict %}
            {% if items.tag == "conductance-based" %}
            {% for item in items.models | sort %}
            * :doc:`/models/{{ item | replace(".html", "") }}`
            {% endfor %}
            {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}



Post-synaptic input responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synaptic inputs can be modeled using different kernels to represent
how the `current or conductance` changes over time after a synaptic event.
The type of post-synaptic input (`exp`, `delta`, `alpha`, `beta`) are indicated at
the end of the neuron model name (e.g., ``iaf_psc_delta``)

            :selected:


            Unlike a fixed threshold, an adaptive threshold increases temporarily following each spike and
            gradually returns to its baseline value over time. This mechanism models phenomena
            such as spike-frequency adaptation, where a neuron's responsiveness decreases with sustained
            high-frequency input. A different mechanism to implement similar adaptation behavior is via a spike-triggered hyperpolarizing adaptation current.

   .. grid-item::
      :columns: 10

      NEST provides a number of auxilliary neuron models that can be used for specific purposes such as repeating or
      ignoring particular incoming spike patterns. Use cases for such functionality include testing or benchmarking
      simulator performance, or the creation of shared spiking input patterns to neurons.

        ignore-and-fire – Used for benchmarking

Precise spike timing

  .. grid-item::

      By default, the dynamics of neuronal models are evaluated on a fixed time grid that can be specified before simulation.

      Precise neuron models instead calculate precise rather than grid-constrained spike times. These models are more
      computationally heavy,  but provide better resolution to spike times than a grid-constrained model.
      Spiking neuron networks are often chaotic systems such that an infinitesimal shift in spike time might lead to changes in
      the overall network dynamics.
      In NEST, we label models with precise spike times with  ``ps``.

      See :ref:`our guide on precise spike timing <sim_precise_spike_times>`.

.. _rate_neurons:

Rate neurons
------------

.. grid::

   .. grid-item::
     :columns: 2
     :class: sd-d-flex-row sd-align-major-center

     .. image:: /static/img/rate_neurons_nn.svg

   .. grid-item::

     Rate neurons can approximate biologically realistic neurons but they are also used in artificial neuronal networks
     (also known as recurrent neural networks RNNs).

     Most rate neurons in NEST are implemented as templates based on the non-linearity and noise type.

Type of non-linearity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the type of non-linearity, which in NEST are provided as C++ templates.

The following non-linearity types are available:


 .. dropdown:: Templates with non-linearity

  *  :doc:`/models/gauss_rate`
  *  :doc:`/models/lin_rate`
  *  :doc:`/models/sigmoid_rate`
  *  :doc:`/models/sigmoid_rate_gg_1998`
  *  :doc:`/models/tanh_rate`
  *  :doc:`/models/threshold_lin_rate`

Where is Non-linearity applied?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The boolean parameter ``linear_summation`` determines whether the
input from different presynaptic neurons is first summed linearly and
then transformed by a nonlinearity (``True``), or if the input from
individual presynaptic neurons is first nonlinearly transformed and
then summed up (``False``). Default is ``True``.

You can set this parameter in the parameter dictionary of the rate neuron.



Noise application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. grid-item::
      :columns: 2
      :class: sd-d-flex-row sd-align-major-center

      **Input noise**

      .. image:: /static/img/input_noise_nn.svg


   .. grid-item::

     ``ipn``: Noise is added to the input rate

       :doc:`/models/rate_neuron_ipn`

   .. grid-item::
      :columns: 2
      :class: sd-d-flex-row sd-align-major-center

      **Output noise**

      .. image:: /static/img/output_noise_nn.svg

   .. grid-item::

     ``opn``: Noise is applied to the output rate

       :doc:`/models/rate_neuron_opn`




Use rate neurons in your simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rate models are instantiated from the templates.
To use a rate neuron, the naming convention is ``<non-linearity>_rate_<noise_type>``

For example::

   nest.Create("gauss_rate_opn")

If using the  ``rate_transformer_node`` (see :ref:`below <rate_transformer>`), you can use the following syntax ``rate_transformer_<non-linearity>``

Example::

    nest.Create("rate_transformer_tanh")

        Rate models can also be used as mean-field descriptions for the population-rate dynamics of spiking networks.

      .. tab-item:: Technical details

        * :doc:`/model_details/siegert_neuron_integration`

.. _rate_transformer:

Rate transformer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to transform rates in a non-linear manner, but do not want any neuronal dynamics processing these rates, then you can use the rate transformer node.

The :doc:`rate_transformer_node </models/rate_transformer_node>` applies a non-linearity
to a sum of incoming rates, transforming them before passing on to other nodes.
