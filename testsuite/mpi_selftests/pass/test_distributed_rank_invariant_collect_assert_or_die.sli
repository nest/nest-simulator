Name: testsuite::test_distributed_rank_invariant_collect_assert_or_die - self test of distributed_rank_invariant_collect_assert_or_die

Synopsis: nest_indirect distributed_rank_invariant_collect_assert_or_die.sli -> -

 able to collect the results of an arbitrary number of jobs and
 compare the set of results to the one of the same simulation carried
 out with a different number of jobs.
