    Name: testsuite::test_delay_check - sli script to test delay checking

    Synopsis: (test_delay_check) run

    Description: This script creates a number of synapses and tests, whether min_delay and max_delay
    are set as expected. It will report for each test separately, whether it was passed or failed
