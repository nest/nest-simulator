/* BeginDocumentation
  Name: synaptic_element - Contact point element for the dynamic creation
   and deletion of synapses.

  Description:
   This class represents synaptic element of a node (like Axonl boutons or
   dendritic spines) used for structural plasticity.
   The synaptic elements represent connection points between two neurons. They
   grow according to a homeostatic growth rule. The dynamics of the
   number of synaptic elements is driven by the average electrical activity of
   the neuron (indirectly measured through the Calcium concentration of the
   node). The probability of two neurons creating a new synapse between them,
   depends on the number of available synaptic elements of each neuron.

  Parameters:
   z                double  - Current number of synaptic elements. Stored as a
                              double variable but the actual usable number of
                              synaptic elements is an integer truncated from
  this
                              double value. An standard value for the growth of
  a
                              synaptic element is around 0.0001 elements/ms.
   continuous       boolean - Defines if the number of synaptic elements should
                              be treated as a continuous double number or as an
                              integer value. Default is false.
   growth_rate      double  - The maximum amount by which the synaptic elements
  will
                              change between time steps. In elements/ms.
   tau_vacant       double  - Rate at which vacant synaptic elements will decay.
                              Typical is 0.1 which represents a
                              loss of 10% of the vacant synaptic elements each
  time
                              the structural_plasticity_update_interval is
                              reached by the simulation time.
   growth_curve     GrowthCurve* - Rule which defines the dynamics of this
  synaptic element.
