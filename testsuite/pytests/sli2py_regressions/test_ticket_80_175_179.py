"""
Regression test for ticket #80, #175 and #179.

This set of test verifies that ``voltmeter`` and ``spike_recorder`` record
identical signals from ``iaf_psc_alpha`` driven by internal DC independent
of how simulation time is blocked and how elements are placed in script.
Additionally, two spike generators, placed before and after the recorders,
emit the same spike trains that are expected from the neurons for the given
parameters.

    Fixture for setting up and simulating the system.

    The system is set up and simulated according to the following protocol:

        1. One ``iaf_psc_alpha`` created before voltmeters and spike recorders,
        one after.
        2. Devices recording from both neurons.
        3. Neurons driven by internal DC current.
        4. Resolution fixed, but simulation time subdivided in different ways.

    The fixture returns the ``spike_recorder`` and ``voltmeter``
    devices used for retrieval of recording data in subsequent comparisons.
