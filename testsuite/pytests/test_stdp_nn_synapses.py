    Test the weight change by STDP
    with three nearest-neighbour spike pairing schemes.
    The test is performed by generating two Poisson spike trains,
    feeding them to NEST as presynaptic and postsynaptic,
    then reconstructing the expected weight change outside of NEST
    and comparing the actual weight change to the expected one.

    The outside-of-NEST STDP implementation made here is not very beautiful,
    but deliberately made so in order to be as independent from NEST as
    possible: it does not involve additional variables for eligibility traces.
    Instead, it directly iterates through the spike history.
