/** @BeginDocumentation

Name: testsuite::ticket-452 - Ensure that precise simulations give identical results whether stepped or run continuously

Synopsis: (ticket-452) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
Ensure that simulations with precise spike timing yield identical results independent of
whether one simulates the full simulation time without interruption, or splits the simulation
into many small pieces.

The problem was unrelated to the setting of kernel property  /off_grid_spiking
and the spike_recorder property  /precise_times.

Author: Hans Ekkehard Plesser, 2010-09-30; based on original reproduced code by Alexander Hanuschkin
