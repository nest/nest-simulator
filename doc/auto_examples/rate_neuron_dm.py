rate_neuron decision making
------------------

A binary decision is implemented in the form of two rate neurons
engaging in mutual inhibition.

Evidence for each decision is reflected by the mean of Gaussian
white noise experienced by the respective neuron.
The activity of each neuron is recorded using multimeter devices.

It can be observed how noise as well as the difference in evidence
affects which neuron exhibits larger activity and hence which
decision will be made.

    D1 = nest.Create('lin_rate_ipn', params=Params)
    D2 = nest.Create('lin_rate_ipn', params=Params)

    nest.Connect(D1, D2, 'all_to_all', {
        'model': 'rate_connection_instantaneous', 'weight': -0.2})
    nest.Connect(D2, D1, 'all_to_all', {
        'model': 'rate_connection_instantaneous', 'weight': -0.2})

    mm = nest.Create('multimeter')
    nest.SetStatus(mm, {'interval': dt, 'record_from': ['rate']})
    nest.Connect(mm, D1, syn_spec={'delay': dt})
    nest.Connect(mm, D2, syn_spec={'delay': dt})

    return D1, D2, mm


'''
The function build_network takes the standard deviation of Gaussian
white noise and the time resolution as arguments.
First the Kernel is reset and the use_wfr (waveform-relaxation) is set to
false while the resolution is set to the specified value dt.
Two rate neurons with linear activation functions are created and the
handle is stored in the variables D1 and D2. The output of both decision
units is rectified at zero.
The two decisions units are coupled via mutual inhibition.
Next the multimeter is created and the handle stored in mm and the option
'record_from' is set. The multimeter is then connected to the two units
in order to 'observe' them.  The connect function takes the handles as input.
'''

The decision making process is simulated for three different levels of noise
and three differences in evidence for a given decision. The activity of both
decision units is plotted for each scenario.

    '''
    The activity of the two units is plottedin each scenario.

    In the absence of noise, the network will not make a decision if evidence
    for both choices is equal. With noise, this symmetry can be broken and a
    decision wil be taken despite identical evidence.

    As evidence for D1 relative to D2 increases, it becomes more likely that
    the corresponding decision will be taken. For small differences in the
    evidence for the two decisions, noise can lead to the 'wrong' decision.
