Name: testsuite::test_hpc_synapse - Basic tests on hpc synapses

Synopsis:

(test_hpc_synapse) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Test basic properties of HPC synapses as follows: 
1. For all known synapses with _hpc ending and counterparts without _hpc 
connect spike generator to one neuron with normal, one with _hpc synapse, 
ensure that simulation yields identical membrane potentials. 
2. Check that adding and freezing/thawing of nodes either is blocked or 
does not affect results, i.e., that the TargetIdentifierIndicies are ok. 
These tests proceed as follows: 
1. Connect spike_generator to N neurons with different weights, 
disable spiking in receptors. We use membrane potential after simulation 
as indicator for through which synpse a neuron received input. 
2. Build network once with plain static_synapse to get reference data. 
3. Then build with respective test cases and compare.
