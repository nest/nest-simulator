Name: testsuite::test_random_clipped - test clipped random number distributions

Synopsis:

(test_random_clipped.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails


Description:

/normal_clipped is an example of a clipped random number distribution. 
Here we test whether the distribution can be connected to a random 
number generator, it can be parameterized, and the range of the 
resulting random numbers is correct.
