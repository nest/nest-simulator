r"""Class encapsulating the network for solving Sudoku
----------------------------------------------------------------
The class SudokuNet constructs a network of LIF neurons with static synapses
that due to their connectivity rules can converge on valid solutions for Sudoku.


Notes
~~~~~
The functionality of the network lies entirely within the inhibitory
connections between neuron populations. Each population of size ``n_digit``
encodes a digit between 1 and 9 in one of the 81 cells and has outgoing
inhibitory connections to several other populations. Namely all populations
coding for the same digit in the same row, column and 3x3 box of the sudoku
field, since a given digit can only ever occur once in any of those three. It
also inhibits all populations in the same cell which encode different digits
to force the network to converge on a single digit per cell.

If the network is simulated with just this configuration and some background
noise, it converges naturally on states that represent valid solutions for
Sudoku.

If populations coding for specific digits in some of the cells are stimulated
externally (therefore inhibiting all other digits in the same cell), the
network usually converges on a solution compatible with the input
configuration, thus solving the puzzle.
