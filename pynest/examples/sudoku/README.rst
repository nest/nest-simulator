NEST Sudoku
===========

A PyNEST implementation of Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem.

You can run the solver using ``sudoku_solver.py``. It will display the
solution in the end.

To visualize the solution process, you can afterwards run ``plot_progress.py``;
this requires the ``imageio`` package.
