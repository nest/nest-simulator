r"""Template demonstrating how to create examples for PyNEST
----------------------------------------------------------------
[[ Titles should be one line and state what the example does.
  It should begin with a verb in the present tense and include type of model
  and/or method]]

[[ Extended summary - a detailed explanation of your example. Try to answer the
   folowing questions. ]]
[[ What does this script do? What is the purpose? ]]
This template demonstrates how to create an example Python script for
NEST.
Copy this file and replace the sample text with a description of your
example script.

Make sure to remove any text that is irrelevant for your example!

The format is based on `NumPy style docstring
<https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ and uses
reStructuredText markup. Please review the syntax rules if you are
unfamiliar with either reStructuredText or NumPy style docstrings.
Your example should contain a complete code-block that begins with all
necessary imports and ends with code that displays the output.

Below is a more concrete example of how an extended summary could look like:

This script simulates a neuron by an excitatory and an inhibitory
population of neurons firing a Poisson spike train.
Optimization is performed using the `bisection` method from Scipy,
which simulates the network repeatedly.

The aim of this example script is to find a firing rate for the inhibitory
population that will make the neuron fire at the same rate as the excitatory
population.

[[ What kind of output is expected? ]]

The output shows the target neuron's membrane potential as a function of time.

[[ Does this example have a real world application or use case?
  Are there particular applications or areas of research that would benefit
  from this example? You can reference relevant papers that this example
  may be based on]]

This model used here is applicable for neurorobotics, particularly cases of ...

[[ If applicable, state any prerequisite the reader needs to have installed or
   configured that is not standard ]]

Please ensure that you have configured MUSIC to be ON in your NEST
configuration:
``cmake -Dwith-music=[ON</path/to/music>]``

[[ If applicable, mention the literature reference for this example.
   Note the syntax of the citation. And don't forget to add a "References"
   section! ]]

This model used here corresponds to the formulation presented in
Sander et al. [1]_ and the bisection method developed in
Gewaltig and Diesmann [2]_.

[[ See Also section - Include a couple of related examples, models,
   or functions. ]]

Notes
------
[[ Additional information can be included here regarding background theory,
   relevant mathematical equations etc. ]]

The value of :math:`\omega` is X.
Time-averaged from the spiking simulation:
[[ Note the syntax used for displaying equations uses reStructuredText
   directive with LaTeX math formulae ]]

.. math::

    X(e^{j\omega } ) = x(n)e^{ - j\omega n}

 * you can use the asterisk for bullet items
 * bullet points are usually more easily read than paragraphs
