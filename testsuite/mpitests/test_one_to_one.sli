    Name: testsuite::test_one_to_one - Test correct connection with many targets
    Synopsis: (test_one_to_one) run -> -

    Description:
    test_one_to_one.sli checks that all-to-all connections are created
    correctly if the number of targets exceeds the number of local nodes.

% With one MPI process, conventional looping is used. We use that as
% reference case. For 4 processes, we will have fewer local nodes than
% targets and inverse looping is used.
