Name: testsuite::test_iaf_ps_psp_poisson_spike_accuracy - test  precise poisson spike input to neuron model

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_ps_psp_poisson_spike_accuracy) run -> compare with analytical  solution


Description:

The tests generates a poisson spike train using a random number 
generator and random number distribution available in the SLI 
programming language. In a second step this spike train is supplied to 
a neuron model and the resulting subthreshold membrane potential 
fluctuations are compared to the analytical solution.  Thus, in 
contrast to the more advanced test_iaf_ps_psp_poisson_accuracy, this 
test does not require the interaction of the generator and the neuron 
model to work and does not require the availability of a parrot 
neuron.  In contrast to test_iaf_ps_psp_poisson_accuracy the DC 
required to maintain a subthreshold membrane potential is generated by 
a dc generator not a property of the neuron model.  The 
spike_generator used to supply the neuron model with spikes, 
constraints spike times to the tic grid of the simulation kernel. This 
is the temporal resolution in which the computation step size and 
simulation times are expressed. Therefore, the results of simulations 
at different computation step sizes only differ because of limited 
machine precision.  The difference between the analytical result and 
the simulation, however, is dictated by the number of tics per 
millisecond.
