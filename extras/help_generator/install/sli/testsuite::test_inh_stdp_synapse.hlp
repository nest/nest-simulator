Name: testsuite::test_inh_stdp_synapse - basic test of stdp_synapse

Synopsis:

(test_inh_stdp_synapse) run


Description:

A parrot_neuron that repeats the spikes from a poisson generator is 
connected to an iaf_psc_alpha that is driven by inh. and exc. poisson input. 
The synapse is an stdp_synapse. After the simulation, we go through the pre- 
and postsyn. spike-trains spike by spike and try to reproduce the STDP 
results. The final weight obtained after simulation is compared to the final 
weight obtained from the test.
