NEST Git workflow
=================

Basic Git setup
---------------

The NEST development takes place in a repository using the Git version control system.
The following sections document the general steps required to set up a working
installation of Git. If you have Git set up already, skip to the :ref:`workflow` section.

Installation and global setup
#############################

1. `Install Git <http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_.
2. Introduce yourself to Git:

.. code::

   git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
   git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"

Setting up your GitHub account
##############################

The NEST source code is hosted in a public repository on
`GitHub <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator>`_. If you don't have a GitHub
account already, please create one.

You then need to configure your account to allow write access - please see the
`article on generating SSH keys <http://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys>`_
on the `GitHub help website <https://help.github.com/>`_.

.. _fork:

Making your own copy (fork) of NEST
###################################

This needs to be done only once. The instructions here are very similar to the
`instructions on GitHub <http://help.github.com/forking/>`_, which you can refer
to for more details. This documentation includes a version specific to NEST.

Creating your own forked copy of NEST
#####################################

1. Login to your GitHub account.
2. Go to the `NEST source code repository <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator>`_ on GitHub.
3. Click on the ``Fork`` button.

After a short pause, you should find yourself at the home page for your own
forked copy of NEST.

Downloading your fork
#####################

After forking the repository, you need to download (*clone*) it to your local computer to
work with the code.

The following commands should do it. The next section explains the commands.

.. code::

   git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/nest-simulator.git
   cd nest-simulator
   git remote add upstream git://github.com/nest/nest-simulator.git

Commands explained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Clone your fork**

.. code::

  git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/nest-simulator.git

This downloads your fork to your local system.  Investigate. Change directory
to your new repository: ``cd nest-simulator``.
Then ``git branch -a`` to show you all branches. You'll get something like:

.. code::

   * master
   remotes/origin/master

This tells you that you are currently on the ``master`` branch, and that you
also have a ``remote`` connection to ``origin/master``. The ``master`` branch is the
default branch and this is where code that has been reviewed and tested resides.
``origin/master`` is just a copy of the ``master`` branch on your system on the ``remote``.

What remote repository is ``remote/origin``? Try ``git remote -v`` to see the web
address for the remote. It should point to your GitHub fork.

Next, you connect your local copy to the central
`NEST GitHub repository <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator>`_, so that you
can keep your local copy and remote fork up to date in the future. By convention,
the main source code repository is usually called ``upstream``.

**Link your repository to the upstream repository**

.. code::

   cd nest-simulator
   git remote add upstream git://github.com/nest/nest-simulator.git

.. note::

   We've used ``git://`` in the web address instead of ``git@``.
   The ``git://`` web address is read only and ensures that you don't make any
   accidental changes to the ``upstream`` repository (if you have permissions to
   write to it, of course).

Check that you have a new ``remote`` set up with ``git remote -v show``. You should
see something like this:

.. code::

   upstream     git://github.com/nest/nest-simulator.git (fetch)
   upstream     git://github.com/nest/nest-simulator.git (push)
   origin       git@github.com:your-user-name/nest-simulator.git (fetch)
   origin       git@github.com:your-user-name/nest-simulator.git (push)

.. _workflow:

Suggested development workflow
------------------------------

Once you've already set up your forked copy of the NEST source code
repository, you can now start making changes to it. The following
sections document the suggested Git workflow.

Basic workflow
##############

In short:

1. Start a *new branch* for each set of changes that you intend to make. See
   the :ref:`feature_branch` section below.
2. Hack away! See the section that documents the :ref:`editing`.
3. When you are satisfied with your edits, push these changes to your own GitHub fork,
   and open a pull request to notify the development team that you'd like
   to make these changes available at the ``upstream`` repository.
   The steps for this are documented in the :ref:`pull_request` section.

This suggested workflow helps to keep the source code repository properly
organized. It also ensures that the history of changes that have been made to
the source code (called ``commit history``) remains tidy, making it easier to follow.

.. _`feature_branch`:

Making a new feature branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you make any changes, ensure that your local copy is up to date with the
``upstream`` repository.

1. Go to (checkout) the default master branch

.. code::

   git checkout master

2. Download (fetch) changes from upstream

.. code::

   git fetch upstream

3. Update your master branch - merge any changes that have been made upstream

.. code::

   git merge upstream/master --ff-only

4. Update the remote for your fork

.. code::

   git push origin master

We suggest using the ``--ff-only`` flag since it ensures that a new
commit is not created when you merge the changes from ``upstream`` into your
``master`` branch. Using this minimises the occurrence of superfluous merge
commits in the commit history.

Now that you have the latest version of the source code, create a new branch
for your work and check it out:

.. code::

   git checkout -b my-new-feature master

This starts a new branch called ``my-new-feature`` from ``master``.


It is extremely important to work on the latest available source code. If you
work on old code, it is possible that in the meantime, someone else has
already made more changes to the same files that you have also edited. This
will result in `merge conflicts
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#Basic-Merge-Conflicts>`_
and resolving these is extra work for both the development team and you. It
also muddles up the ``commit history`` of the source code.

.. _editing:

Editing workflow - command list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Improve ``modified_file`` with your text editor/IDE.
2. Confirm what files have changed in the repository.

.. code::

   git status

3. Review the changes you've made (optional).

.. code::

   git diff

4. Inform Git that you want to save these changes.

.. code::

   git add modified_file

5. Save these changes.

.. code::

  git commit

6. Push these changes to the remote for your fork.

.. code::

   git push origin my-new-feature

Editing workflow - commands explained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make some changes. When you feel that you've made a complete, working set of
   related changes, move on to the next steps.
2. Please ensure that you have followed the coding guidelines for
   C++ and SLI coding guidelines.
3. Test your changes by building the source code and running the tests.
   (Usually ``cmake``, ``make``, ``make install``, ``make installcheck``. Please see the
   :ref:`installation section <install_nest>` for details.)
4. Check which files have changed with ``git status``. You'll see a listing like this one:

   .. code::

      On branch my-new-feature
      Changed but not updated:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

      modified:   README

      no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

5. Compare the changes with the previous version using ``git diff``.
   This brings up a simple text browser interface that highlights the difference
   between your files and the previous version like this:

   .. code::

      diff --git a/development_workflow.rst b/development_workflow.rst
      index f05f0cd..e581f00 100644
      --- a/development_workflow.rst
     +++ b/development_workflow.rst
      @@ -8,17 +8,22 @@ layout: index

6. Inform Git of what modified or new files you want to save (stage) using ``git add modified_file``.
   This puts the files into a ``staging area``, which is a
   list of files that will be added to your next commit. Only add files that have
   related, complete changes. Leave files with unfinished changes for later
   commits.

7. To commit the staged files into the local copy of your repository, run
   ``git commit``. Write a clear Git commit message that describes the changes
   that you have made. Please read `this article <http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_
   on writing commit messages. If a commit fixes an open issue on the `GitHub issue
   tracker <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues>`_, include
   ``Fixes #issue_number`` in the commit message. GitHub finds such keywords and
   closes the issue automatically when the pull request is merged. For a list of
   all keywords you can use, refer to `this GitHub help
   page <https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/>`_.
   After saving your message and closing the editor, your commit will be saved.

8. Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

   .. code::

      git push origin my-new-feature

Assuming you have followed the instructions in these pages, Git will create
a default link to your GitHub repository called ``origin``. In Git >= 1.7 you can
ensure that the link to origin is permanently set by using the ``--set-upstream``
option:

.. code::

   git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature

From now on, Git will know that ``my-new-feature`` is related to the
``my-new-feature`` branch in your own GitHub repository. Subsequent push calls
are then simplified to the following:

.. code::

   git push

It often happens that while you were working on your edits, new commits have
been added to ``upstream`` that affect your work. In this case, you will need to
reposition your commits on the new master. Please follow the
`git rebase <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase>`_ instructions.

Next, we see how to create a pull request.

.. _pull_request:

Creating a pull request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you feel your work is finished, you can create a pull request (PR). GitHub
has a nice help page that outlines the process for
`submitting pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#initiating-the-pull-request>`_.

Please check out our :ref:`coding style guidelines <code_style_cpp>` and
:ref:`code review guidelines <code_guidelines>` prior to submitting it.
