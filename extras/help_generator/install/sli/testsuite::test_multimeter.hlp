Name: testsuite::test_multimeter - Minimal test for correct multimeter setup

Synopsis:

(test_multimeter) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test provides a minimal check for correct multimeter setup. 
For each model with a "recordables" property, it creates an instance, 
connects a multimeter to them requestin all properties, simulates briefly 
and checks that the correct number of data items is collected for each 
recordable. 
This test mainly ensures that init_buffers_() initializes the data logger. 
If a developer has forgotten to add recordables to get_status(), this test 
will ignore the pertaining neuron.
