Name: readline - read and edit a line from standard input

Synopsis:

any readline -> any true 
-> false


Description:

readline takes anything from the prompt as a string and prints it. 
If something is added, readline pushes the additional phrase as string 
plus a true on the stack (that means readline reads a line from 
standard input). If nothing is added false is pushed.
