 subthreshold dynamics
   Non-spiking backgound activity of the synapses.

 autapse
   A neuron connected to itself.

 multapse
   A neuron that has (multiple) synapses with another neuron.

 spike-timing dependent plasticity
   STDP, a form of plasticity which adjusts the connection strength between neurons based on the relative timing of a neurons output and input spikes.

 spike train
   A sequence of actions potentials. Usually seen as events in integrate-and-fire models.

 depressing window
   A function that determines how synaptic modification depends on spike-timing (STDP).

 dendritic arbor
   Dendritic trees formed to create new synapses.

 axon
   The output structure of a neuron.

 Clopath
   Refering to the Clopath plasticity rule.

 plasticity
   The ability of a network to grow or reorganize.

   A mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons can be generated and how they propagate.

 refractory time
   A time period in which neurons cannot fire due to depolarization.

 Point process
   A temporal point process is a mathematical model for a time series of discrete events.
