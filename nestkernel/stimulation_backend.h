/**
 * Abstract bass class for all NESTio stimulation backends
 *
 * This class provides the interface for NESTio stimulation backends
 * with which StimulationDevices can be enrolled for receiving
 * stimulation data that they can use to updating their parameters at
 * the beginning of each run.
 *
 * Built-in stimulation backends are registered in the constructor of
 * IOManager by inserting an instance of each of them into a std::map
 * under the name of the backend. The default backend, the one using
 * memory, are not registered in this map.
 *
 * A user level call to Simulate internally executes the sequence
 * Prepare → Run → Cleanup.  During Prepare, the prepare() function of
 * each backend is called by the IOManager. This gives the backend an
 * opportunity to prepare itself for being ready to receive the data.
 *
 * The user level function Run drives the simulation main loop by
 * updating all the stimulation device. At its beginning it calls
 * pre_run_hook() on each stimulation backend via the IOManager.
 * This function is used to receive or read data and update the
 * stimulation devices. At the end of each run, it calls post_run_hook()
 * on each stimulation backend via IOManager.
 *
 * During the simulation, stimulation backends do nothing. This solution
 * was chosen to avoid complex synchronization, but can be changed in the future
 * if the need shall arise.

   * Enroll a `StimulationDevice` with the `StimulationBackend`.
   *
   * When this function is called by a `StimulationDevice` @p device,
   * the `StimulationBackend` can set up per-device data structures and
   * properties. Individual device instances can be identified using
   * the `thread` and `node_id` of the @p device.
   *
   * This function is called from the set_initialized_() function of
   * the @p device and their set_status() function.
   *
   * A backend needs to be able to cope with multiple calls to this
   * function, as multiple calls to set_status() may occur on the @p
   * device. For already enrolled devices this usually means that only
   * the parameters in @p params have to be set, but no further
   * actions are needed.
   *
   * Each stimulation backend must ensure that enrollment (including all
   * settings made by the user) is persistent over multiple calls to
   * Prepare, while the enrollment of all devices should end with a
   * call to finalize().
   *
   * A common implementation of this function will create an entry in
   * a thread-local map, associating the device's node ID with the
   * device-specific backend properties and an input facility of some
