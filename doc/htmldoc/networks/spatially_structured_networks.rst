Spatially-structured networks
=============================

NEST provides  a convenient interface for creating neurons placed in
space and connecting those neurons with probabilities and
properties depending on the relative placement of neurons. This permits
the creation of complex networks with spatial structure.

This user manual provides an introduction to the functionalities provided for
defining spatial networks in NEST. It is based exclusively on the PyNEST, the
Python interface to NEST. NEST users using the SLI
interface should be able to map instructions to corresponding SLI code.
This manual is not meant as a comprehensive reference manual. Please
consult the online documentation in PyNEST for details; where
appropriate, that documentation also points to relevant SLI
documentation.

This manual describes the spatial functionalities included with NEST 3.0.

In the next sections of this manual, we introduce the commands and
concepts required to work with spatially distributed nodes. In
particular,

*  section :ref:`sec_connections` describes how to connect spatial
   nodes with each other
*  section :ref:`sec_inspection` explains how you can inspect and
   visualize spatial networks.
*  section :ref:`sec_custom_masks` deals with creating connection
   boundaries using parameters, and the more advanced topic of
   extending the functionalities with custom masks provided by C++
   classes in an extension module.

The Python scripts used throughout this manual are found in the NEST
sources under ``doc/htmldoc/networks/scripts``.

There may be a number of undocumented features, which you may discover
by browsing the code. These features are highly experimental and
should *not be used for simulations*, as they have not been validated.

Spatially distributed nodes
---------------------------

Neuronal networks can have an organized spatial distribution, which we
call *layers*. Layers are NodeCollections with spatial metadata. We
will first illustrate how to place elements in simple grid-like
layers, where each element is a single model neuron, before describing
how the elements can be placed freely in space.

We will illustrate the definition and use of spatially distributed
NodeCollections using examples.

NEST distinguishes between two classes of layers:

grid-based layers
   in which each element is placed at a location in a regular grid;

free layers
   in which elements can be placed arbitrarily in the plane.

Grid-based layers allow for more efficient connection-generation under
certain circumstances.

Grid-based NodeCollections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sec_spatial_verysimple:

A very simple example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We create a first, grid-based simple NodeCollection with the following command:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer1 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer1:

.. figure:: figures/layer1.png
   :name: fig:layer1

   Simple grid-based NodeCollection centered about the origin. Blue circles mark
   the elements, the thin square the extent of the layer. Row and
   column indices are shown in the right and top margins, respectively.

The layer is shown in :numref:`fig_layer1`. Note the following properties:

-  We are using the standard :py:func:`.Create` function, but in addition to model
   type, we are also passing a ``nest.spatial.grid`` object as the
   ``positions`` argument.

-  The layer has five *rows* and five *columns*, as given by ``shape=[columns, rows]``.
   Note that a more intuitive way of thinking of *shape* is to think of it as given by
   ``shape=[num_x, num_y]``.

-  The *center* of the NodeCollection is at the origin of the coordinate system,
   :math:`(0,0)`.

-  The *extent* or size of the layer is :math:`1\times  1`. This is the
   default size for grid-based layers. The extent is marked by the thin
   square in :numref:`fig_layer1`.

-  The *grid spacing* of the layer is

.. math::
      :label: dx_dy_extent

      \begin{split}
      dx &= \frac{\text{x-extent}}{\text{number of columns}} \\
      dy &= \frac{\text{y-extent}}{\text{number of rows}}
      \end{split}

In the layer shown, we have :math:`dx=dy=0.2`,
but the grid spacing may differ in x- and y-direction.

-  Layer elements are spaced by the grid spacing and are arranged
   symmetrically about the center.

-  The outermost elements are placed :math:`dx/2` and :math:`dy/2`
   from the borders of the extent.

-  Element *positions* in the coordinate system are given by
   :math:`(x,y)` pairs. The *coordinate system* follows that standard
   mathematical convention that the :math:`x`-axis runs from left to
   right and the :math:`y`-axis from bottom to top.

-  Each element of a grid-based NodeCollection has a *row- and column-index* in
   addition to its :math:`(x,y)`-coordinates. Indices are shown in the
   top and right margin of  :numref:`fig_layer1`. Note that row-indices
   follow matrix convention, i.e., run from top to bottom. Following
   pythonic conventions, indices run from 0.

.. _sec_setextent:

Setting the extent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grid-based layers have a default extent of :math:`1\times 1`. You can specify a
different extent of a layer, i.e., its size in :math:`x`- and
:math:`y`-direction by passing the ``extent`` argument to ``nest.spatial.grid()``:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer2 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer2:

.. figure:: figures/layer2.png
   :name: fig:layer2

   Same layer as in :numref:`fig_layer1`, but with different extent.

The resulting NodeCollection is shown in :numref:`fig_layer2`. The extent is always
a two-element list of floats. In this example, we have grid spacings
:math:`dx=0.4` and :math:`dy=0.1`. Changing the extent does not affect
grid indices.

The size of ``extent`` in :math:`x`- and :math:`y`-directions should
be numbers that can be expressed exactly as binary fractions. This is
automatically ensured for integer values. Otherwise, under rare
circumstances, subtle rounding errors may occur and trigger an
assertion, thus stopping NEST.

Setting the center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Layers are centered about the origin :math:`(0,0)` by default. This can
be changed by passing the ``center`` argument to ``nest.spatial.grid()``.
The following code creates layers centered about :math:`(0,0)`,
:math:`(-1,1)`, and :math:`(1.5,0.5)`, respectively:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer3 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer3:

.. figure:: figures/layer3.png
   :name: fig:layer3

   Three layers centered, respectively, about :math:`(0,0)` (blue),
   :math:`(-1,-1)` (green), and :math:`(1.5,0.5)` (red).

The center is given as a two-element list of floats. Changing the
center does not affect grid indices: For each of the three layers in
:numref:`fig_layer3`, grid indices run from 0 to 4 through columns and
rows, respectively, even though elements in these three layers have
different positions in the global coordinate system.

The ``center`` coordinates should be numbers that can be expressed
exactly as binary fractions. For more information, see the section
:ref:`sec_setextent`.

Constructing a layer: an example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see how to construct a layer, consider the following example:

-  a layer with :math:`n_y` rows and :math:`n_x` columns;

-  spacing between nodes is :math:`d` in :math:`x`- and
   :math:`y`-directions;

-  the left edge of the extent shall be at :math:`x=0`;

-  the extent shall be centered about :math:`y=0`.

From Eq. :eq:`dx_dy_extent`, we see that the extent of the NodeCollection must be
:math:`(n_x d, n_y d)`. We now need to find the coordinates
:math:`(c_x, c_y)` of the center of the layer. To place the left edge of
the extent at :math:`x=0`, we must place the center of the layer at
:math:`c_x=n_x d / 2` along the :math:`x`-axis, i.e., half the extent
width to the right of :math:`x=0`. Since the layer is to be centered
about :math:`y=0`, we have :math:`c_y=0`. Thus, the center coordinates
are :math:`(n_x d/2, 0)`. The layer is created with the following code
and shown in :numref:`fig_layer3a`:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer3a #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer3a:

.. figure:: figures/layer3a.png
   :name: fig:layer3a

   NodeCollection with :math:`n_x=5` columns and :math:`n_y=3` rows, spacing
   :math:`d=0.1` and the left edge of the extent at :math:`x=0`,
   centered about the :math:`y`-axis. The cross marks the point on the
   extent placed at the origin :math:`(0,0)`, the circle the center of
   the layer.

Free layers
~~~~~~~~~~~

*Free layers* do not restrict node positions to a grid, but allow free
placement within the extent. To this end, the user can specify the
positions of all nodes explicitly, or pass a random distribution
parameter to ``nest.spatial.free()``. The following code creates a NodeCollection of
50 ``iaf_psc_alpha`` neurons uniformly distributed in a layer with
extent :math:`1\times 1`, i.e., spanning the square
:math:`[-0.5,0.5]\times[-0.5,0.5]`:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer4 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer4:

.. figure:: figures/layer4.png
   :name: fig:layer4

   A free layer with 50 elements uniformly distributed in an extent of
   size :math:`1\times 1`.

Note the following points:

-  For free layers, element *positions* are specified by the
   ``nest.spatial.free`` object.

-  The ``pos`` entry must either be a Python ``list`` (or ``tuple``) of
   element coordinates, i.e., of two-element tuples of floats giving the
   (:math:`x`, :math:`y`)-coordinates of the elements, or a ``Parameter`` object.

-  When using a parameter object for the positions, the number of dimensions have to be specified
   by the ``num_dimensions`` variable. num_dimensions can either be 2 or 3.

-  When using a parameter object you also need to specify how many elements you want to create
   by specifying ``'n'`` in the :py:func:`.Create` call. This is **not** the case when you pass a list to
   the ``nest.spatial.free`` object.

-  The extent is automatically set when using ``nest.spatial.free``, however, it
   is still possible to set the extent yourself by passing the ``extent`` variable to the object.

-  All element positions must be *within* the layer's extent. Elements
   may be placed on the perimeter of the extent as long as no periodic
   boundary conditions are used; see the section :ref:`sec_periodic`.

To create a spatially distributed NodeCollection from a list, do the following:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer4b #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer4b:

.. figure:: figures/layer4b.png
   :name: fig:layer4b

   A free layer with 3 elements freely distributed space. The extent is given by the gray lines.

Note that when using a list to specify the positions, neither ``'n'`` nor ``num_dimenstions``
are specified. Furthermore, the extent is calculated from the node positions, and is here
:math:`1.45\times 1.45`. The extent could also be set by passing the ``extent`` argument.

3D layers
~~~~~~~~~

Although the term "layer" suggests a 2-dimensional structure, the layers
in NEST may in fact be 3-dimensional. The example from the previous
section may be easily extended by updating number of dimensions for the positions:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer4_3d #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer4_3d:

.. figure:: figures/layer4_3d.png
   :name: fig:layer4_3d

   A free 3D layer with 200 elements uniformly distributed in an extent
   of size :math:`1\times 1\times 1`.

Again it is also possible to specify a list of list to create nodes in a 3-dimensional
space. Another possibility is to create a 3D grid-layer, with 3 elements passed to
the shape argument, ``shape=[nx, ny, nz]``:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer4_3d_b #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_layer4_3d_b:

.. figure:: figures/layer4_3d_b.png
   :name: fig:layer4_3d_b

   A grid 3D NodeCollection with 120 elements distributed on a grid with 4 elements in the x-direction,
   5 elements in the y-direction and 6 elements in the z-direction, with an extent
   of size :math:`1\times 1\times 1`.


.. _sec_periodic:

Periodic boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simulations usually model systems much smaller than the biological
networks we want to study. One problem this entails is that a
significant proportion of neurons in a model network is close to the
edges of the network with fewer neighbors than nodes properly inside the
network. In the :math:`5\times 5`-layer in :numref:`fig_layer1` for instance., 16
out of 25 nodes form the border of the layer.

One common approach to reducing the effect of boundaries on simulations
is to introduce *periodic boundary conditions*, so that the rightmost
elements on a grid are considered nearest neighbors to the leftmost
elements, and the topmost to the bottommost. The flat layer becomes the
surface of a torus. :numref:`fig_player` illustrates this for a
one-dimensional layer, which turns from a line to a ring upon
introduction of periodic boundary conditions.

You specify periodic boundary conditions for a NodeCollection using
the entry ``edge_wrap``:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ player #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_player:

.. figure:: figures/player.png
   :name: fig:player

   Top left: Layer with single row and five columns without periodic
   boundary conditions. Numbers above elements show element coordinates.
   Colors shifting from blue to magenta mark increasing distance from
   the element at :math:`(-2,0)`. Bottom left: Same layer, but with
   periodic boundary conditions. Note that the element at :math:`(2,0)`
   now is a nearest neighbor to the element at :math:`(-2,0)`. Right:
   Layer with periodic boundary condition arranged on a circle to
   illustrate neighborhood relationships.

Note that the longest possible distance between two elements in a layer
without periodic boundary conditions is

.. math:: \sqrt{x_{\text{ext}}^2 + y_{\text{ext}}^2}

but only

.. math:: \left.\sqrt{x_{\text{ext}}^2 + y_{\text{ext}}^2}\right/ 2

for a layer with periodic boundary conditions; :math:`x_{\text{ext}}`
and :math:`y_{\text{ext}}` are the components of the extent size.

We will discuss the consequences of periodic boundary conditions more in
the section on :ref:`sec_connections`.

Layers as NodeCollection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the perspective of NEST, a layer is a special type of
*NodeCollection*. From the user perspective, the following points may
be of interest:

-  The NodeCollection has a ``spatial`` property describing the spatial
   properties of the NodeCollection (``l`` is the layer created at the beginning
   of this guide):

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer1s #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.log
    :start-after: #{ layer1s.log #}
    :end-before: #{ end.log #}



The ``spatial`` property is read-only; changing any value will
not change properties of the spatially distributed NodeCollection.

-  NEST sees the elements of the layer in the same way as the
   elements of any other NodeCollection. NodeCollections created as layers can
   therefore be used in the same ways as any standard NodeCollection.
   However, operations requiring a NodeCollection with spatial data (e.g.
   :py:func:`.Connect` with spatial dependence, or visualization of layers) can
   only be used on NodeCollections created with spatial distribution.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.py
    :start-after: #{ layer1p #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: scripts/layers.log
    :start-after: #{ layer1p.log #}
    :end-before: #{ end.log #}

.. _sec_connections:

Connections
-----------

The most important feature of the spatially-structured networks is the ability to
create connections between NodeCollections with quite some flexibility. In this
chapter, we will illustrate how to specify and create connections. All
connections are created using the :py:func:`.Connect` function.

Basic principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sec_spatial_terminology:

Terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^

We begin by introducing important terminology:

Connection
   In the context of connections between the elements of NodeCollections with spatial
   distributions, we often call the set of all connections between pairs of
   network nodes created by a single call to :py:func:`.Connect` a
   *connection*.

Connection dictionary
   A dictionary specifying the properties of a connection between two
   NodeCollections in a call to :py:func:`.Connect`.

Source
   The *source* of a single connection is the node sending signals
   (usually spikes). In a projection, the source layer is the layer from
   which source nodes are chosen.

Target
   The *target* of a single connection is the node receiving signals
   (usually spikes). In a projection, the target layer is the layer from
   which target nodes are chosen.

Driver
   When connecting two layers, the *driver* layer is the one in which
   each node is considered in turn.

Pool
   | When connecting two layers, the *pool* layer is the one from which
     nodes are chosen for each node in the driver layer. I.e., we have

   +--------------------------------+--------------+--------------+
   | Connection parameters          | Driver       | Pool         |
   +================================+==============+==============+
   | ``rule='pairwise_bernoulli'``  | source layer | target layer |
   +--------------------------------+--------------+--------------+
   | ``rule='fixed_outdegree'``     | source layer | target layer |
   +--------------------------------+--------------+--------------+
   | ``rule='pairwise_bernoulli'``  | target layer | source layer |
   | and ``use_on_source=True``     |              |              |
   +--------------------------------+--------------+--------------+
   | ``rule='fixed_indegree'``      | target layer | source layer |
   +--------------------------------+--------------+--------------+

Displacement
   The *displacement* between a driver and a pool node is the shortest
   vector connecting the driver to the pool node, taking boundary
   conditions into account.

Distance
   The *distance* between a driver and a pool node is the length of
   their displacement.

Mask
   The *mask* defines which pool nodes are at all considered as
   potential targets for each driver node. See section
   :ref:`sec_conn_masks` for details.

Connection probability or ``p``
   The *connection probability*, specified as ``p`` in the connection
   specifications, is either a value, or a parameter which specifies the
   probability for creating a connection between a driver and a pool node.
   The default probability is :math:`1`, i.e., connections are created with
   certainty. See section :ref:`sec_conn_kernels` for details.

Autapse
   An *autapse* is a synapse (connection) from a node onto itself.
   Autapses are permitted by default, but can be disabled by adding
   ``'allow_autapses': False`` to the connection dictionary.

Multapse
   Node A is connected to node B by a *multapse* if there are synapses
   (connections) from A to B. Multapses are permitted by default, but
   can be disabled by adding ``'allow_multapses': False`` to the
   connection dictionary.

Connecting spatially distributed nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


As with "normal" NodeCollections, connections between spatially distributed nodes are created
by calling :py:func:`.Connect`. However, having spatial information about the nodes makes
position-based options available, and so in addition to the usual connection
schemes there exists additional connection parameters for spatially distributed
NodeCollections.

In many cases when connecting spatially distributed NodeCollections, a
mask will be specified. Mask specifications are described in the
section :ref:`sec_conn_masks`. Only neurons within the mask are
considered as potential sources or targets. If no mask is given, all
neurons in the respective NodeCollection are considered sources or
targets.

Here is a simple example, cf. :numref:`fig_conn1`

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn1 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn1:

.. figure:: figures/conn1.png
   :name: fig:conn1

   Left: Minimal connection example from a layer onto itself using a
   rectangular mask shown as red for the node at :math:`(0,0)`
   (marked light red). The targets of this node are marked with red
   dots. The targets for the node at :math:`(4,5)` are marked with
   yellow dots. This node has fewer targets since it is at the corner
   and many potential targets are beyond the layer. Right: The effect of
   periodic boundary conditions is seen here. Source and target layer
   and connection dictionary were identical, except that periodic
   boundary conditions were used. The node at :math:`(4,5)` now has 15
   targets, too, but they are spread across the corners of the layer. If
   we wrapped the layer to a torus, they would form a :math:`5\times 3`
   rectangle centered on the node at :math:`(4,5)`.

In this example, layer ``l`` is both source and target layer. For each
node in the NodeCollection we choose targets according to the rectangular mask
centered about each source node. Since the connection probability is 1.0,
we connect to all nodes within the mask. Note the effect of normal and
periodic boundary conditions on the connections created for different
nodes in the NodeCollection, as illustrated in :numref:`fig_conn1`.

Mapping source and target layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application of masks and other functions depending on the distance
or even the displacement between nodes in the source and target layers
requires a mapping of coordinate systems between source and target
layers. NEST applies the following *coordinate mapping rules*:

1. All layers have two-dimensional Euclidean coordinate systems.

2. No scaling or coordinate transformation can be applied between
   NodeCollections with spatial distribution.

3. The displacement :math:`d(D,P)` from node :math:`D` in the driver
   layer to node :math:`P` in the pool layer is measured by first
   mapping the position of :math:`D` in the driver layer to the
   identical position in the pool layer and then computing the
   displacement from that position to :math:`P`. If the pool layer has
   periodic boundary conditions, they are taken into account. It does
   not matter for displacement computations whether the driver layer has
   periodic boundary conditions.

.. _sec_conn_masks:

Masks
~~~~~

A mask describes which area of the pool layer shall be searched for
nodes when connecting for any given node in the driver layer. We will first
describe geometrical masks defined for all layer types and then consider
grid-based masks for grid-based NodeCollections. If no mask is specified, all
nodes in the pool layer will be searched.

Note that the mask size should not exceed the size of the layer when
using periodic boundary conditions, since the mask would "wrap around"
in that case and pool nodes would be considered multiple times as
targets.

If none of the mask types provided in the library meet your need, you may
define custom masks, either by introducing a cut-off to the connection
probability using parameters, or by adding more mask types in a NEST extension
module. This is covered in the section on :ref:`sec_custom_masks`.

.. _sec_free_masks:

Masks for 2D layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NEST currently provides four types of masks usable for 2-dimensional
free and grid-based NodeCollections. They are illustrated in  :numref:`fig_conn2_a`.
The masks are

Rectangular
   All nodes within a rectangular area are connected. The area is
   specified by its lower left and upper right corners, measured in the
   same unit as element coordinates. Example:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2r #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Circular
   All nodes within a circle are connected. The area is specified by its
   radius.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2c #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Doughnut
   All nodes between an inner and outer circle are connected. Note that
   nodes *on* the inner circle are not connected. The area is specified
   by the radii of the inner and outer circles.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2d #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Elliptical
   All nodes within an ellipsis are connected. The area is specified by
   its major and minor axis.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2e #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn2_a:

.. figure:: figures/conn2_a.png
   :name: fig:conn2_a

   Masks for 2D layers. For all mask types, the driver node is marked by
   a wide light-red circle, the selected pool nodes by red dots and the
   masks are red. From left to right, top to bottom: rectangular,
   circular, doughnut and elliptical masks centered about the driver
   node.

By default, the masks are centered about the position of the driver
node, mapped into the pool layer. You can change the location of the
mask relative to the driver node by specifying an ``'anchor'`` entry in
the mask dictionary. The anchor is a 2D vector specifying the location
of the mask center relative to the driver node, as in the following
examples (cf.  :numref:`fig_conn2_b`).

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2ro #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2co #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2do #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2eo #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn2_b:

.. figure:: figures/conn2_b.png
   :name: fig:conn2_b

   The same masks as in :numref:`fig_conn2_a`, but centered about
   :math:`(-1.5,-1.5)`, :math:`(-2,0)`, :math:`(1.5,1.5)` and
   :math:`(2, -1)`, respectively, using the ``'anchor'`` parameter.

It is, as of NEST 2.16, possible to rotate the :math:`\textbf{rectangular}`
and :math:`\textbf{elliptical}` masks, see Fig :numref:`fig_conn2_b`. To do so,
add an ``'azimuth_angle'`` entry in the specific mask dictionary. The
``azimuth_angle`` is measured in degrees and is the rotational angle
from the x-axis to the y-axis.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2rr #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn2er #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn2_c:

.. figure:: figures/conn2_c.png
   :name: fig:conn2_c

   Rotated rectangular and elliptical mask from  :numref:`fig_conn2_a` and
   :numref:`fig_conn2_b`, where the rectangular mask is rotated
   :math:`120^\circ` and the elliptical mask is rotated :math:`45^\circ`.

.. _sec_3d_masks:

Masks for 3D layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly, there are three mask types that can be used for 3D NodeCollections,

Box
   All nodes within a cuboid volume are connected. The area is specified
   by its lower left and upper right corners, measured in the same unit
   as element coordinates. Example:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_3d_a #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Spherical
   All nodes within a sphere are connected. The area is specified by its
   radius.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_3d_b #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Ellipsoidal
   All nodes within an ellipsoid are connected. The area is specified by
   its major, minor, and polar axis.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_3d_c #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

As in the 2D case, you can change the location of the mask relative to
the driver node by specifying a 3D vector in the ``'anchor'`` entry in
the mask dictionary. If you want to rotate the box or ellipsoidal masks,
you can add an ``'azimuth_angle'`` entry in the specific mask dictionary
for rotation from the x-axis towards the y-axis about the z-axis, or a
``'polar_angle'`` entry, specifying the rotation angle in degrees from
the z-axis about the (possibly rotated) x axis, from the (possibly
rotated) y-axis. You can specify both at once of course. If both are
specified, we first rotate about the z-axis and then about the new
x-axis. NEST currently does not support rotation in all three directions,
the rotation from the y-axis about the (possibly rotated) z-axis, from
the (possibly rotated) x-axis is missing.

   Masks for 3D NodeCollections. For all mask types, the driver node is marked by
   a wide light-red circle, the selected pool nodes by red dots and the
   masks are red. From left to right: box and spherical masks
   centered about the driver node.

Masks for grid-based layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grid-based layers can be connected using rectangular *grid masks*. For
these, you specify the size of the mask not by lower left and upper
right corner coordinates, but give their size in x and y direction, as in
this example:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn3 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

The resulting connections are shown in :numref:`fig_conn3`. By default
the top-left corner of a grid mask, i.e., the grid mask element with
grid index :math:`[0,0]`\ (see :ref:`2.1.1 <sec_spatial_verysimple>`), is
aligned with the driver node. You can change this alignment by
specifying an *anchor* for the mask:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn3c #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

You can even place the anchor outside the mask:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn3x #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

The resulting connection patterns are shown in  :numref:`fig_conn3`.

.. _fig_conn3:

.. figure:: figures/conn3.png
   :name: fig:conn3

   Grid masks for connections between grid-based layers. Left:
   :math:`5\times 3` mask with default alignment at upper left corner.
   Center: Same mask, but anchored to center node at grid index
   :math:`[1,2]`. Right: Same mask, but anchor to the upper left of the
   mask at grid index :math:`[-1,2]`.

Connections specified using grid masks are generated more efficiently
than connections specified using other mask types.

Note the following:

-  Grid-based masks are applied by considering grid indices. The
   position of nodes in physical coordinates is ignored.

-  In consequence, grid-based masks should only be used between NodeCollections
   with identical grid spacings.

-  The semantics of the ``'anchor'`` property for grid-based masks
   differ significantly for general masks described in the section
   :ref:`sec_free_masks`. For general masks, the anchor is the center
   of the mask relative to the driver node. For grid-based nodes, the
   anchor determines which mask element is aligned with the driver
   element.

Probabilistic connection rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many neuronal network models employ probabilistic connection rules.
NEST supports probabilistic connections through the
``pairwise_bernoulli`` connection rule. The probability can then be a constant,
depend on the position of the source or the target neuron, or on the
distance between a driver and a pool node to a connection probability. To
create dependencies on neuron positions, NEST parameters objects are used.
NEST then generates a connection according to this probability.

Probabilistic connections between layers can be generated in two different
ways:

Free probabilistic connections using ``pairwise_bernoulli``
   In this case, :py:func:`.Connect` considers each driver node :math:`D` in turn.
   For each :math:`D`, it evaluates the parameter value for each pool node
   :math:`P` within the mask and creates a connection according to the
   resulting probability. This means in particular that *each possible
   driver-pool pair is inspected exactly once* and that there will be *at
   most one connection between each driver-pool pair*.

Prescribed number of connections
   can be obtained by using ``fixed_indegree`` or ``fixed_outdegree``
   connection rule, and specifying the number of connections to create
   per driver node. See the section :ref:`sec_prescribed_numbers`
   for details.

A selection of specific NEST parameters pertaining to spatially
structured networks are shown the table below.

   Illustration of various connection probabilities. Top left: constant probability,
   :math:`p=0.5`. Top right: Distance dependent Gaussian probability, green distribution show
   :math:`\sigma`. Bottom left: Same distance dependent
   Gaussian probability, but all :math:`p<0.5` treated as :math:`p=0`. Bottom
   right: 2D-Gaussian.

Several examples follow. They are illustrated in  :numref:`fig_conn4`.

Constant
   Fixed connection probability:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn4cp #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Gaussian
   The connection probability is a Gaussian distribution based on the distance
   between neurons. In the example, connection
   probability is 1 for :math:`d=0` and falls off with a "standard
   deviation" of :math:`\sigma=1`:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn4g #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Cut-off Gaussian
   In this example we have a distance-dependent Gaussian distributon,
   where all probabilities less than :math:`0.5` are set to zero:

.. TODO: Reference to full Parameter table with nest.logic.conditional().

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn4cut #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

2D Gaussian
   We conclude with an example using a two-dimensional Gaussian
   distribution, i.e., a Gaussian with different widths in :math:`x`- and
   :math:`y`- directions. This probability depends on displacement, not
   only on distance:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn42d #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Note that for pool layers with periodic boundary conditions, NEST
always uses the shortest possible displacement vector from driver to
pool neuron as ``nest.spatial.distance``.

Weights and delays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameters, such as those presented in Table :ref:`tbl_parameters`, can
also be used to specify distance-dependent or randomized weights and
delays for the connections created by :py:func:`.Connect`. Weight and delays are in NEST
passed along in a synapse dictionary to the ``Connect()`` call.

::

    nest.Connect(nodes, nodes, conn_dict, syn_dict)


Figure :numref:`fig_conn5` illustrates weights and delays generated using these
parameters. The code examples used to generate the figures are shown below.
All examples use a spatially distributed NodeCollection
of 51 nodes placed on a line; the line is centered about :math:`(25,0)`,
so that the leftmost node has coordinates :math:`(0,0)`. The distance
between neighboring elements is 1. The mask is rectangular, spans the
entire NodeCollection and is centered about the driver node.


Linear example
  .. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
      :start-after: #{ conn5lin #}
      :end-before: #{ end #}

  Results are shown in the top panel of  :numref:`fig_conn5`. Connection
  weights and delays are shown for the leftmost neuron as driver. Weights
  drop linearly from :math:`1`. From the node at :math:`(20,0)` on, the
  cutoff sets weights to 0. There are no connections to nodes beyond
  :math:`(25,0)`, since the mask extends only 25 units to the right of the
  driver. Delays increase in a stepwise linear fashion, as NEST requires
  delays to be multiples of the simulation resolution.


Linear example with periodic boundary conditions
  .. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
      :start-after: #{ conn5linpbc #}
      :end-before: #{ end #}

  Results are shown in the middle panel of  :numref:`fig_conn5`. This example
  is identical to the previous, except that the (pool) layer has periodic
  boundary conditions. Therefore, the left half of the mask about the node
  at :math:`(0,0)` wraps back to the right half of the layer and that node
  connects to all nodes in the layer.


Various spatially dependent distributions
  .. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
      :start-after: #{ conn5exp #}
      :end-before: #{ end #}

  .. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
      :start-after: #{ conn5gauss #}
      :end-before: #{ end #}

  Results are shown in the bottom panel of :numref:`fig_conn5`. It shows
  linear, exponential and Gaussian distributions of the distance between
  connected nodes, used with weight functions for the node at
  :math:`(25,0)`.


Randomized weights and delays
  .. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
      :start-after: #{ conn5uniform #}
      :end-before: #{ end #}

  By using the ``nest.random.uniform()`` parameter for weights or delays, one can
  obtain randomized values for weights and delays, as shown by the red
  circles in the bottom panel of :numref:`fig_conn5`.

   details.

Designing distance-dependent parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although NEST comes with some pre-defined functions that can be used to
create distributions of distance-dependent parameters, there is no limit
to how parameters can be combined.

.. TODO: reference to parameter documentation

As an example, we will now combine some parameters to create a new parameter that is
linear (actually affine) with respect to the displacement between the nodes, of the form

.. math:: p = 0.5 + d_x + 2 d_y.

\ where :math:`d_x` and :math:`d_y` are the displacements between the source and
target neuron on the x and y axis, respectively. The parameter is then simply:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_param_design #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

This can be directly plugged into the :py:func:`.Connect` function:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn_param_design_ex #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Periodic boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections between layers with periodic boundary conditions are based
on the following principles:

-  Periodic boundary conditions are always applied in the pool layer. It
   is irrelevant whether the driver layer has periodic boundary
   conditions or not.

-  By default, NEST does not accept masks that are wider than the
   pool layer when using periodic boundary conditions. Otherwise, one
   pool node could appear as multiple targets to the same driver node as
   the masks wraps several times around the layer. For layers with
   different extents in :math:`x`- and :math:`y`-directions this means
   that the maximum layer size is determined by the smaller extension.

-  ``nest.spatial.distance`` and its single dimension variants
   always consider the shortest distance (displacement) between driver and
   pool node.

In most physical systems simulated using periodic boundary conditions,
interactions between entities are short-range. Periodic boundary
conditions are well-defined in such cases. In neuronal network models
with long-range interactions, periodic boundary conditions may not make
sense. In general, we recommend to use periodic boundary conditions only
when connection masks are significantly smaller than the NodeCollections they are
applied to.

.. _sec_prescribed_numbers:

Prescribed number of connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have so far described how to connect spatially distributed NodeCollections by either connecting to all
nodes inside the mask or by considering each pool node in turn and
connecting it according to a given probability function. In both cases,
the number of connections generated depends on mask and connection
probability.

Many neuron models in the literature, in contrast, prescribe a certain
*fan in* (number of incoming connections) or *fan out* (number of outgoing
connections) for each node. You can achieve this in NEST by
prescribing the number of connections for each driver node by using
``fixed_indegree`` or ``fixed_outdegree`` as connection rule.

Connection generation now proceeds in a different way than before:

1. For each driver node, :py:func:`.Connect` randomly selects a node from
   the mask region in the pool layer, and creates a connection with the
   probability prescribed. This is repeated until the
   requested number of connections has been created.

2. Thus, if all nodes in the mask shall be connected with equal
   probability, you should not specify a connection probability.

3. If you specify a probability with a distance-dependent distribution
   (e.g., Gaussian, linear, exponential), the connections will be
   distributed within the mask with the spatial profile given by the
   probability.

4. If you prohibit multapses (see section :ref:`sec_spatial_terminology`)
   and prescribe a number of connections greater than the number of pool
   nodes in the mask, ``Connect()`` may get stuck in an infinite
   loop and NEST will hang. Keep in mind that the number of nodes within
   the mask may vary considerably for free layers with randomly placed
   nodes.

5. If you use the connection rule ``'rule': fixed_indegree`` in the connection
   dictionary, you also have to specify ``'indegree'``, the number of connections
   per target node.

6. Similarly, if you use the connection rule ``'rule': fixed_outdegree`` in the connection
   dictionary, you have to use ``'outdegree'`` to specify the number of connections
   per source node.

The following code generates a network of 1000 randomly placed nodes and
connects them with a fixed fan out, of 50 outgoing connections per node
distributed with a profile linearly decaying from unit probability to
zero probability at distance :math:`0.5`. Multiple connections
(multapses) between pairs of nodes are allowed, self-connections
(autapses) prohibited. The probability of finding a connection at a
certain distance is then given by the product of the probabilities for
finding nodes at a certain distance with the probability value for this
distance. For the connection probability and parameter values below we have


.. math::
   :label: eq_ptheo

   p_{\text{conn}}(d) = \frac{12}{\pi} \times 2\pi r \times (1-2r)
    = 24 r (1-2r) \qquad \text{for} \quad 0\le r < \frac{1}{2}\;.\qquad

The resulting distribution of distances between connected nodes is shown in
 :numref:`fig_conn6`.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn6 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

.. _fig_conn6:

.. figure:: figures/conn6.png
   :name: fig:conn6

   Distribution of distances between source and target for a network of
   1000 randomly placed nodes, a fixed fan out of 50 connections and a
   connection probability decaying linearly from 1 to 0 at
   :math:`d=0.5`. The red line is the expected distribution from
   Eq. :eq:`eq_ptheo`.

Functions determining weight and delay as function of
distance/displacement work in just the same way as before when the
number of connections is prescribed.

It is also possible to use a random parameter or spatially dependent parameter
to set the number of incoming or outgoing connections.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn7 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Synapse models and properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, :py:func:`.Connect` creates connections using the default synapse
model in NEST, :hxt_ref:`static_synapse`. You can specify a different model by
adding a ``'synapse_model'`` entry to the synapse specification
dictionary, as in this example:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn8 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

You have to use synapse models if you want to set, e.g., the receptor
type of connections or parameters for plastic synapse models. These can
not be set in distance-dependent ways at present.

.. _sec_dev_subregions:

Connecting devices to subregions of NodeCollections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to connect stimulation and recording devices only to
specific subregions of the layers. A simple way to achieve this is to create
a layer which contains only the device placed typically in its center.
When connecting the device layer to a neuron layer, an appropriate mask
needs to be specified and optionally also an anchor for shifting the
center of the mask. As demonstrated in the following example,
stimulation devices have to be connected as the source layer.

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn9 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

While recording devices, on the other hand, have to be connected as
the target layer (see also the following section):

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn10 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Spatially distributed NodeCollections and recording devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, one should not create a layer of recording devices to record from
another NodeCollection with spatial extent. This is especially true for spike recorders. Instead,
create a single spike recorder and connect all neurons in the spatially
distributed NodeCollection to that spike recorder:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/connections.py
    :start-after: #{ conn11 #}
    :end-before: #{ end #}

Connecting a layer of neurons to a layer of recording devices as
described in the section on :ref:`sec_dev_subregions`, is only
possible using the ``pairwise_bernoulli`` rule. Note that voltmeter
and :hxt_ref:`multimeter` do not suffer from this restriction, since they are
connected as sources, not as targets.

.. _sec_inspection:

Inspecting spatially distributed NodeCollections
------------------------------------------------

We strongly recommend that you inspect the NodeConnections created to
be sure that node placement and connectivity indeed turned out as
expected. In this section, we describe some functions that NEST

connectivity.

Visualization functions

| :py:func:`.PlotLayer`                | Plot nodes in a spatially distributed    |
|                                      | NodeCollection.                          |

.. _fig_vislayer:

.. figure:: figures/vislayer.png
   :name: fig:vislayer

   :math:`21\times 21` grid with divergent Gaussian projections onto
   itself. Blue circles mark layer elements, red circles connection
   targets of the center neuron. The
   large red circle is the mask, the green distribution mark
   the Gaussian probability distribution.

The following code shows a practical example: A :math:`21\times21` network
which connects to itself with Gaussian connections. The resulting graphics
is shown in :numref:`fig_vislayer`. All elements and the targets of the
center neuron are shown, as well as mask and connection probability.

.. _sec_custom_masks:

Creating custom masks
---------------------

In some cases, the built-in masks may not meet your needs, and you want to
create a custom mask. There are two ways to do this:

1. To use parameters to introduce a cut-off to the connection probability.
2. To implement a custom mask in C++ as a module.

Using parameters is the most accessible option; the entire implementation is done on
the PyNEST level. However, the price for this flexibility is reduced connection efficiency
compared to masks implemented in C++. Combining parameters to give the wanted behaviour may
also be difficult if the mask specifications are complex.

Implementing a custom mask in C++ gives much higher connection performance and greater freedom
in implementation, but requires some knowledge of the C++ language. As the mask in this case
is implemented in an extension module, which is dynamically loaded into NEST, it also requires
some additional steps for installation.

Using parameters to specify connection boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use parameters that represent spatial distances between nodes to create a connection
probability with mask behaviour. For this, you need to create a condition parameter that describes
the boundary of the mask. As condition parameters evaluate to either ``0`` or ``1``, it can be
used alone, with the ``nest.logic.conditional()`` parameter, or multiplied with another
parameter or value, before passing it as the connection probability.

As an example, suppose we want to create connections to 50 % of the target nodes, but only to those
within an elliptical area around each source node. Using ``nest.spatial.distance`` parameters, we
can define a parameter that creates an elliptical connection boundary.

First, we define variables controlling the shape of the ellipse.

::

   rx = 0.5   # radius in the x-direction
   ry = 0.25  # radius in the y-direction

Next, we define the connection boundary. We only want to connect to targets inside an ellipse, so
the condition is

.. math::

   \frac{x^2}{r_x^2}+\frac{y^2}{r_y^2} \leq 1,

where :math:`x` and :math:`y` are the distances between the source and target neuron, in x- and
y-directions, respectively. We use this expression to define the boundary using parameters.

::

   x = nest.spatial.distance.x
   y = nest.spatial.distance.y
   lhs = x * x / rx**2 + y * y / ry**2
   mask_param = nest.logic.conditional(lhs <= 1.0, 0.5, 0.0)
   # Because the probability outside the ellipse is zero,
   # we could also have defined the parameter as
   # mask_param = 0.5*(lhs <= 1.0)

Then, we can use the parameter as connection probability when connecting populations with spatial
information.

::

   l = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', positions=nest.spatial.grid(shape=[11, 11], extent=[1., 1.]))
   nest.Connect(l, l, {'rule': 'pairwise_bernoulli', 'p': mask_param})

Adding masks in a module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If using parameters to define a connection boundary is not efficient enough, or
if you need more flexibility in defining the mask, you can add a custom mask,
written in C++, and add it to NEST via an extension module. For more information
on writing such modules, see the :doc:`NEST extension module repository <extmod:index>`.

To add a mask, a subclass of ``nest::Mask<D>`` must be defined, where ``D``
is the dimension (2 or 3). In this case we will define a 2-dimensional
elliptic mask by creating a class called ``EllipticMask``.

Please note that elliptical masks are already part of NEST (see
:ref:`sec_conn_masks`). However, that elliptical mask is defined in a
different way than what we will do here though, so this can still be
used as an introductory example. First, we must include the header
files for the ``Mask`` parent class:

.. code:: c

   #include "mask.h"
   #include "mask_impl.h"

The ``Mask`` class has a few methods that must be overridden:

.. code:: c

   class EllipticMask : public nest::Mask< 2 >
   {
   public:
     EllipticMask( const DictionaryDatum& d )
       : rx_( 1.0 )
       , ry_( 1.0 )
     {
       updateValue< double >( d, "r_x", rx_ );
       updateValue< double >( d, "r_y", ry_ );
     }

     using Mask< 2 >::inside;

     // returns true if point is inside the ellipse
     bool
     inside( const nest::Position< 2 >& p ) const
     {
       return p[ 0 ] * p[ 0 ] / rx_ / rx_ + p[ 1 ] * p[ 1 ] / ry_ / ry_ <= 1.0;
     }

     // returns true if the whole box is inside the ellipse
     bool
     inside( const nest::Box< 2 >& b ) const
     {
       nest::Position< 2 > p = b.lower_left;

       // Test if all corners are inside mask
       if ( not inside( p ) )
         return false; // (0,0)
       p[ 0 ] = b.upper_right[ 0 ];
       if ( not inside( p ) )
         return false; // (0,1)
       p[ 1 ] = b.upper_right[ 1 ];
       if ( not inside( p ) )
         return false; // (1,1)
       p[ 0 ] = b.lower_left[ 0 ];
       if ( not inside( p ) )
         return false; // (1,0)

       return true;
     }

     // returns bounding box of ellipse
     nest::Box< 2 >
     get_bbox() const
     {
       nest::Position< 2 > ll( -rx_, -ry_ );
       nest::Position< 2 > ur( rx_, ry_ );
       return nest::Box< 2 >( ll, ur );
     }

     nest::Mask< 2 >*
     clone() const
     {
       return new EllipticMask( *this );
     }

   protected:
     double rx_, ry_;
   };

The overridden methods include a test if a point is inside the mask, and
for efficiency reasons also a test if a box is fully inside the mask. We
implement the latter by testing if all the corners are inside, since our
elliptic mask is convex. We must also define a function which returns a
bounding box for the mask, i.e. a box completely surrounding the mask.

The mask class must then be registered in NEST. This
is done by adding a line to the function ``MyModule::init()`` in the file
``mymodule.cpp``:

.. code:: c

   nest::NestModule::register_mask< EllipticMask >( "elliptic" );

After compiling and installing your module, the mask is available to be
used in connections, e.g.

::

   nest.Install('mymodule')
   l = nest.Create('iaf_psc_alpha', positions=nest.spatial.grid(shape=[11, 11], extent=[1., 1.]))
   nest.Connect(l, l, {'rule': 'pairwise_bernoulli',
                       'p': 0.5,
                       'mask': {'elliptic': {'r_x': 0.5, 'r_y': 0.25}}})
