Name: testsuite::test_gsd- Test global spike detector with pure MPI parallelism

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_gsd.sli -> -

Description:
This script tests the gsd spike detector scheme by comparing the
output of 2 poisson generators on 2 MPI procs run in conventional mode
to the output on 3 MPI procs run in gsd mode.
