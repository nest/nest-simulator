# Conda environment specification for NEST Simulator
#
# This file specifies a conda environment for those who would
# like to compile NEST or build NEST documentation themselves.
# If you just want to execute NEST, you should install NEST
# directly as described in https://www.nest-simulator.org/installation.
#
#
# The environment specification below is comprehensive: it includes
# all packages required to build and run NEST with OpenMP and MPI
# parallelisation, GSL-dependent models, NumPy and Pandas-dependent
# features of PyNEST and examples requiring Matplotlib, and to run
# the NEST testsuite. It also comprises all tools required to build
# NEST documentation and to run NEST Server. The requirements for the
# documentation and server are marked in separate sections below so
# you can remove them if you would like a leaner environment.
#
# NOTE: Do NOT delete the PIP section at the end of the file. Environment files
#       allow just a single PIP section. All dependencies not satisfied by
#       conda-forge are placed there.
#
# NOTE: libneurosim, MUSIC and SIONLib are not included in this environment.
#
# To create an environment from this file, run
#
#     conda env create --name <my_env_name> --file environment.yml
#
# where <my_env_name> is a name of your choice.
