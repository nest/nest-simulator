E-prop plasticity examples
==========================


.. image:: eprop_supervised_regression_sine-waves.png

Eligibility propagation (e-prop) [1]_ is a three-factor learning rule for spiking neural networks that
approaches the performance of backpropagation through time (BPTT). The original TensorFlow implementation of
e-prop was demonstrated, among others, on a supervised regression task to generate temporal patterns and a
supervised classification task to accumulate evidence [2]_. Here, you find tutorials on how to reproduce these
two tasks as well as two more advanced regression tasks using the NEST implementation of e-prop [3]_ and how to
visualize the simulation recordings.

The tutorials labeled "after Bellec et al. (2020)" use the original e-prop model [1]_, while the other
tutorials use a version of e-prop that includes additional biological features as described in [3]_.

See below for a diagram that describes the relationships between the different models for e-prop.

Users interested in endowing an existing model with e-prop plasticity, may compare the .cpp and .h files of the
:doc:`iaf_psc_delta</models/iaf_psc_delta>` and :doc:`eprop_iaf_psc_delta</models/eprop_iaf_psc_delta>` model.
Parameters to run the `eprop_iaf_psc_delta` model are provided in
:doc:`eprop_supervised_regression_sine-waves.py <eprop_supervised_regression_sine-waves>`.
