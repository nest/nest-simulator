def test_iaf_psc_alpha_basic():
    """
    An overall test of the iaf_psc_alpha model connected
    to some useful devices.

    A DC current is injected into the neuron using a current generator
    device. The membrane potential as well as the spiking activity are
    recorded by corresponding devices.

    It can be observed how the current charges the membrane, a spike
    is emitted, the neuron becomes absolute refractory, and finally
    starts to recover.

    The timing of the various events on the simulation grid is of
    particular interest and crucial for the consistency of the
    simulation scheme.

    Although 0.1 cannot be represented in the IEEE double data type, it
    is safe to simulate with a resolution (computation step size) of 0.1
    ms because by default nest is built with a timebase enabling exact
    representation of 0.1 ms.

    It is tested whether the voltage traces of simulations
    carried out at different resolutions (computation step sizes) are well
    aligned and identical when the neuron recovers from refractoriness.

    In grid based simulation a prerequisite is that the spike is reported at
    a grid position shared by all the resolutions compared.

    Here, we compare resolutions 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 ms. Therefore, the
    internal DC current is adjusted such (1450.0 pA) that the spike is
    reported at time 3.0 ms, corresponding to computation step 30, 15, 6,
    and 3, respectively.

    The results are consistent with those of iaf_psc_alpha_ps capable of
