"""
This script suggest C/CPP include orders that conform to the NEST coding style
guidelines. Call the script like (from NEST sources):

For one file:
    python extras/include_checker.py -nest $PWD -f nest/main.cpp

For one directory:
    python extras/include_checker.py -nest $PWD -d nest

If everything is OK, or only few includes are in the wrong order, it will print
something like:

    Includes for main.cpp are OK! Includes in wrong order: 0

If something is wrong, it will print the suggestion:

    Includes for neststartup.h are WRONG! Includes in wrong order: 5

    ##############################
    Suggested includes for neststartup.h:
