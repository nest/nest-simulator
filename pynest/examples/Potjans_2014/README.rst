Cortical microcircuit model
===========================

This is a PyNEST implementation of the cortical microcircuit model by Potjans and Diesmann [1]_.
The network model represents four layers of cortex, L2/3, L4, L5, and L6, each consisting of a population of excitatory neurons and a population of inhibitory neurons.

Citing this code
----------------

If you use this code, we ask you to cite the paper by Potjans and Diesmann [1]_ and the NEST release on Zenodo.

Running the simulation
----------------------

By default, the variables ``N_scaling`` and ``K_scaling`` in ``network_params.py`` are set to
`0.1`, which is a good choice for running the microcircuit on a local machine.
``N_scaling`` adjusts the number of neurons and ``K_scaling`` adjusts the indegrees.
The full network can be run by setting these values to `1`.
If this is done, the option to print the time progress should be switched off: ``'print_time': False`` in ``sim_params.py``.

To run the simulation, simply use:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 run_microcircuit.py

The output will be saved in the ``data`` directory.

The code can be `parallelized <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/parallel_computing.html>`_ using OpenMP and MPI, if NEST has been built with these features.
The number of threads (per MPI process) can be chosen by adjusting ``local_num_threads`` in ``sim_params.py``.


.. important::

   When scaling up the microcircuit model, you may encounter errors during simulation when there is less than 4 virtual processes.
   The number of threads should, therefore, be 4 or more. You can increase
   the number of MPI processes or set either ``local_num_threads`` to a value >= 4 or replace ``local_num_threads`` by ``total_num_virtual_procs`` and set it to a value >= 4.

   For more information about MPI processes and threading see :ref:`our guide on HPC systems <optimize_performance>`.

The command for running the script with four MPI processes is:

.. code-block:: bash

   mpirun -n 4 python3 run_microcircuit.py

External drive and initial conditions
-------------------------------------

By default, the simulation uses external Poissonian input to excite all neuronal populations of the microcircuit, i.e., ``poisson_input': True`` in ``network_params.py``.
If set to ``False``, the Poissonian input is turned off and compensated approximately by calculated direct current (DC) input.
In addition to this ongoing external drive, a thalamic stimulation or a stimulation by an external DC input can be switched on in ``stimulus_params.py`` (the default for both types of stimuli is ``False``).

The default random initialization of membrane voltages in this simulation uses population-specific means and standard deviations to reduce an initial activity burst in the network: ``'V_type': 'optimized'`` in ``network_params.py``.
Previous implementations used the same mean and standard deviation for all populations, which is here achieved by setting ``'V_type': 'original'``.

Recommendations for benchmarking
--------------------------------

For benchmark simulations assessing network-construction and state-propagation times, the recommended changes to the default parameters are the following:

``sim_params.py``:

* ``'t_sim': 10000.0``: The biological simulation time should be at least `10` s for measuring the state propagation time.
* ``'rec_dev': []``: No recording devices.
* ``'local_num_threads': t``: Adjust the number of threads ``t`` per MPI process as needed for the benchmarks.
* ``'print_time': False'``: No printing of time progress.

``network_params.py``:

* ``'N_scaling': 1.``: Full number of neurons.
* ``'K_scaling': 1.``: Full indegrees.
* ``'poisson_input': False``: DC background input.
