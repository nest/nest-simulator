Name: testsuite::test_iaf_min_delay_simblocks - sli script for testing block wise simulation

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_min_delay_simblocks) run -> compares results for different min_delays


Description:

The simulation is run with a range of different min_delays. All 
should give identical results. This is achieved by sampling the 
membrane potential at a fixed interval. 
The test is identical to test_iaf_min_delay_set except that the 
simulation is carried out by 20 subsequent calls of Simulate() 
instead of only a single one. 
Other test scripts discuss the various aspects of this script in detail, 
see the SeeAlso key below. If this test fails go back to the simpler ones.
