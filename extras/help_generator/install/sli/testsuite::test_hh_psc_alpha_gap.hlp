Name: testsuite::test_hh_psc_alpha_gap - sli script for overall test of hh_psc_alpha_gap model 
 with gap_junction connection

Synopsis:

(test_hh_psc_alpha_gap) run -> compares response to current step with reference data


Description:

test_hh_psc_alpha_gap.sli is an overall test of the hh_psc_alpha_gap model connected 
by gap_junction connection. 
Two neurons of whom one receives an constant input current of 200 pA are connected 
by gap_junction with an (unrealistic) high gap weight. The accurate functionality 
of the gap_junction feature is tested by measuring the membrane potential of the 
neuron without input current. 
Although 0.1 cannot be represented in the IEEE double data type, it 
is safe to simulate with a resolution (computation step size) of 0.1 
ms because by default nest is built with a timebase enabling exact 
representation of 0.1 ms. 
The expected output is documented at the end of 
the script. The textual output of the voltmeter documented in this file 
can be regenerated by setting adding /to_screen true to the SetStatus 
call of vm below.
