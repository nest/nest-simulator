  Name: lowpassfilter_spike_detector - Device for detecting single
  spikes and efficiently generating a continuous trace of the activity
  for each node connected to it.

  Description:
  There are 2 parts to this device, it acts as a normal spike_detector, but it
  also generates a continuous trace for
  each node connected to it based on spiking activity. It can be used to record
  spikes from a single neuron or
  spike-generating device, or from many of them at once. Spikes and traces can
  be recorded to memory or file.
  spike events can be accessed from "events". By default, GID and time of each
  spike is recorded.
  filtered spike values can be accessed from "filter_events". GID and time are
  reported as well.

  The decayed value from time "t1" to "t2" is calculated as follows:
  new_trace_value = exp((t1 - t2) / tau_filter) * old_trace_value
  And in response to a spike, the trace is updated as follows:
  new_trace_value = old_trace_value + 1 / tau_filter

  The lowpassfilter_spike_detector can also record spike times and calculate
  traces with full precision
  from neurons emitting precisely timed spikes. Set /precise_times to achieve
  this. The filtering of
  precise models will come at a later version.

  Any node from which spikes are to be recorded (and filtered traces
  calculated), must be connected to
  this device using a normal connect command. Any connection weight and delay
  will be ignored for that connection.
  Recording of spikes can be disabled by setting the \record_spikes parameter to
  false, the trace calculation and
  recording will be unaffected by this.

  Remarks:
  - Filtered traces and spikes are recorded (stored in memory or written to
  screen/file) at multiples of minimum
  delay in the network (+ one resolution increment). For example, if the minimum
  delay in the network is 1.5 ms,
  but simulation resolution and filter_report_interval are 0.1, The results for
  the first 1.5 ms will be recorded
  once the simulation has exceeded 1.5 ms (i.e., nest.Simulate(x) where x is >=
  1.6).
  - Filtered traces and/or spikes are not necessarily written to file in
  chronological order.
  - To get the most performance when only needing the trace at certain times,
  set start_times and stop_times
  with only 1 filter_report_interval intervals. For example, if the trace is
  needed at 50ms and 100ms, specify
  filter_start_times = [49.0, 99.0] , filter_stop_times = [50.0, 100.0] , and
  filter_report_interval = 1.0.
  - When writing to file, spikes and filtered traces are stored in separate
  files. The files that include
  the traces include "filtered" in their name and by default are stored with
  "dat" extension.
  - Setting \n_events to 0 clears both the "events" and "filter_events" on
  memory.

  Parameters:
  /filter_start_times - The start time(s) for reporting the continous trace
  /filter_stop_times - The stop time(s) for reporting the continous trace
  /filter_report_interval - The interval to report the trace in each start, stop
  block.
  /tau_filter - Tau for calculating the trace value.
  /record_spikes - If true, it would also record spikes just as a spike_detector
  would.

/**
 * lowpassfilter_spike_detector.
 *
 * Just like a normal spike_detector, this class manages spike recording for
 * normal and precise spikes. In addition to that, it calculates and records
 * low-pass filtered traces for each node connected to it. It receives spikes
 * via its handle(SpikeEvent&) method, buffers them, and records them via its
 * RecordingDevices in the update() method. Recording of spikes can be disabled
 * by setting the "record_spikes" parameter to false, the trace calculation and
 * recording will be unaffected by this.
 *
 * Spikes are buffered in a two-segment buffer. We need to distinguish between
 * two types of spikes: those delivered from the global event queue (almost all
 * spikes) and spikes delivered locally from devices that are replicated on VPs
 * (has_proxies() == false).
 * - Spikes from the global queue are delivered by deliver_events() at the
 *   beginning of each update cycle and are stored only until update() is called
 *   during the same update cycle. Global queue spikes are thus written to the
 *   read_toggle() segment of the buffer, from which update() reads.
 * - Spikes delivered locally may be delivered before or after
 *   spike_detector::update() is executed. These spikes are therefore buffered
 *in
 *   the write_toggle() segment of the buffer and output during the next cycle.
 * - After all spikes are recorded, update() clears the read_toggle() segment
 *   of the buffer.
