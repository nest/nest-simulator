"""PyNEST - Python interface for the NEST simulator

* ``nest.helpdesk()`` opens the NEST documentation in your browser.

* ``nest.__version__`` displays the NEST version.

* ``nest.Models()`` shows all available neuron, device and synapse models.

* ``nest.help('model_name') displays help for the given model, e.g., ``nest.help('iaf_psc_exp')``

* To get help on functions in the ``nest`` package, use Python's ``help()`` function
  or IPython's ``?``, e.g.

     - ``help(nest.Create)``
     - ``nest.Connect?``
