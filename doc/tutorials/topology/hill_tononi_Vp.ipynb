        "\n NEST Topology Module: A Case-Based Tutorial\n ===========================================\n\n :Author: Hans Ekkehard Plesser\n :Institution: Norwegian University of Life Sciences\n :Version: 0.4\n :Date: 21 November 2012\n :Copyright: The NEST Initiative (2004)\n :License: Creative Commons Attribution License\n\n **NOTE:** The network generated by this script does generate\n dynamics in which the activity of the entire system, especially\n Rp and Vp oscillates with approx 5 Hz. This is different from\n the full model. Deviations are due to the different model type\n and the elimination of a number of connections, with no changes\n to the weights.\n\n Introduction\n ============\n\n This tutorial shows you how to implement a simplified version of the\n Hill-Tononi model of the early visual pathway using the NEST Topology\n module.  The model is described in the paper\n\n   S. L. Hill and G. Tononi.\n   Modeling Sleep and Wakefulness in the Thalamocortical System.\n   J Neurophysiology **93**:1671-1698 (2005).\n   Freely available via `doi 10.1152/jn.00915.2004\n   <http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00915.2004>`_.\n\n We simplify the model somewhat both to keep this tutorial a bit\n shorter, and because some details of the Hill-Tononi model are not\n currently supported by NEST. Simplifications include:\n\n 1. We use the ``iaf_cond_alpha`` neuron model, which is\n    simpler than the Hill-Tononi model.\n\n #. As the ``iaf_cond_alpha`` neuron model only supports two\n    synapses (labeled \"ex\" and \"in\"), we only include AMPA and\n    GABA_A synapses.\n\n #. We ignore the secondary pathway (Ts, Rs, Vs), since it adds just\n    more of the same from a technical point of view.\n\n #. Synaptic delays follow a Gaussian distribution in the HT\n    model. This implies actually a Gaussian distributions clipped at\n    some small, non-zero delay, since delays must be\n    positive. Currently, there is a bug in the Topology module when\n    using clipped Gaussian distribution. We therefore draw delays from a\n    uniform distribution.\n\n #. Some further adaptations are given at the appropriate locations in\n    the script.\n\n This tutorial is divided in the following sections:\n\n Philosophy_\n    Discusses the philosophy applied to model implementation in this\n    tutorial\n\n Preparations_\n    Neccessary steps to use NEST and the Topology Module\n\n `Configurable Parameters`_\n    Define adjustable network parameters\n\n `Neuron Models`_\n    Define the neuron models needed by the network model\n\n Populations_\n    Create Populations\n\n `Synapse models`_\n    Define the synapse models used in the network model\n\n Connections_\n    Create Connections\n\n `Example simulation`_\n    Perform a small simulation for illustration. This\n    section also discusses the setup for recording.\n\n Philosophy\n ==========\n\n A network models has two essential components: *populations* and\n *projections*.  We first use NEST's ``CopyModel()`` mechanism to\n create specific models for all populations and subpopulations in\n the network, and then create the populations using the Topology\n modules ``CreateLayer()`` function.\n\n We use a two-stage process to create the connections, mainly\n because the same configurations are required for a number of\n projections: we first define dictionaries specifying the\n connections, then apply these dictionaries later.\n\n The way in which we declare the network model here is an\n example. You should not consider it the last word: we expect to see\n a significant development in strategies and tools for network\n descriptions in the future. The following contributions to CNS\\*09\n seem particularly interesting\n\n - Ralf Ansorg & Lars Schwabe. Declarative model description and\n   code generation for hybrid individual- and population-based\n   simulations of the early visual system (P57);\n - Sharon Crook, R. Angus Silver, & Padraig Gleeson. Describing\n   and exchanging models of neurons and neuronal networks with\n   NeuroML (F1);\n\n as well as the following paper which will apply in PLoS\n Computational Biology shortly:\n\n - Eilen Nordlie, Marc-Oliver Gewaltig, & Hans Ekkehard Plesser.\n   Towards reproducible descriptions of neuronal network models.\n\n Preparations\n ============\n\n Please make sure that your ``PYTHONPATH`` is set correctly, so\n that Python can find the NEST Python module.\n\n **Note:** By default, the script does not show any graphics.\n Set ``SHOW_FIGURES`` to ``True`` to activate graphics.\n\n This example uses the function GetLeaves, which is deprecated. A\n deprecation warning is therefore issued. For details about deprecated\n functions, see documentation.\n\n"

Configurable Parameters\n# ! =======================\n# !\n# ! Here we define those parameters that we take to be\n# ! configurable. The choice of configurable parameters is obviously\n# ! arbitrary, and in practice one would have far more configurable\n# ! parameters. We restrict ourselves to:\n# !\n# ! - Network size in neurons ``N``, each layer is ``N x N``.\n# ! - Network size in subtended visual angle ``visSize``, in degree.\n# ! - Temporal frequency of drifting grating input ``f_dg``, in Hz.\n# ! - Spatial wavelength and direction of drifting grating input,\n# !   ``lambda_dg`` and ``phi_dg``, in degree/radian.\n# ! - Background firing rate of retinal nodes and modulation amplitude,\n# !   ``retDC`` and ``retAC``, in Hz.\n# ! - Simulation duration ``simtime``; actual simulation is split into\n# !   intervals of ``sim_interval`` length, so that the network state\n# !   can be visualized in those intervals. Times are in ms.\nParams = {'N': 40,\n          'visSize': 8.0,\n          'f_dg': 2.0,\n          'lambda_dg': 2.0,\n          'phi_dg': 0.0,\n          'retDC': 30.0,\n          'retAC': 30.0,\n          'simtime': 100.0,\n          'sim_interval': 5.0\n          }\n\n# ! Neuron Models\n# ! =============\n# !\n# ! We declare models in two steps:\n# !\n# ! 1. We define a dictionary specifying the NEST neuron model to use\n# !    as well as the parameters for that model.\n# ! #. We create three copies of this dictionary with parameters\n# !    adjusted to the three model variants specified in Table~2 of\n# !    Hill & Tononi (2005) (cortical excitatory, cortical inhibitory,\n# !    thalamic)\n# !\n# ! In addition, we declare the models for the stimulation and\n# ! recording devices.\n# !\n# ! The general neuron model\n# ! ------------------------\n# !\n# ! We use the ``iaf_cond_alpha`` neuron, which is an\n# ! integrate-and-fire neuron with two conductance-based synapses which\n# ! have alpha-function time course.  Any input with positive weights\n# ! will automatically directed to the synapse labeled ``_ex``, any\n# ! with negative weights to the synapes labeled ``_in``.  We define\n# ! **all** parameters explicitly here, so that no information is\n# ! hidden in the model definition in NEST. ``V_m`` is the membrane\n# ! potential to which the model neurons will be initialized.\n# ! The model equations and parameters for the Hill-Tononi neuron model\n# ! are given on pp. 1677f and Tables 2 and 3 in that paper. Note some\n# ! peculiarities and adjustments:\n# !\n# ! - Hill & Tononi specify their model in terms of the membrane time\n# !   constant, while the ``iaf_cond_alpha`` model is based on the\n# !   membrane capcitance. Interestingly, conducantces are unitless in\n# !   the H&T model. We thus can use the time constant directly as\n# !   membrane capacitance.\n# ! - The model includes sodium and potassium leak conductances. We\n# !   combine these into a single one as follows:\n# $   \\begin{equation}-g_{NaL}(V-E_{Na}) - g_{KL}(V-E_K)\n# $      = -(g_{NaL}+g_{KL})\n# $        \\left(V-\\frac{g_{NaL}E_{NaL}+g_{KL}E_K}{g_{NaL}g_{KL}}\\right)\n# $   \\end{equation}\n# ! - We write the resulting expressions for g_L and E_L explicitly\n# !   below, to avoid errors in copying from our pocket calculator.\n# ! - The paper gives a range of 1.0-1.85 for g_{KL}, we choose 1.5\n# !   here.\n# ! - The Hill-Tononi model has no explicit reset or refractory\n# !   time. We arbitrarily set V_reset and t_ref.\n# ! - The paper uses double exponential time courses for the synaptic\n# !   conductances, with separate time constants for the rising and\n# !   fallings flanks. Alpha functions have only a single time\n# !   constant: we use twice the rising time constant given by Hill and\n# !   Tononi.\n# ! - In the general model below, we use the values for the cortical\n# !   excitatory cells as defaults. Values will then be adapted below.\n# !\nnest.CopyModel('iaf_cond_alpha', 'NeuronModel',\n               params={'C_m': 16.0,\n                       'E_L': (0.2 * 30.0 + 1.5 * -90.0) / (0.2 + 1.5),\n                       'g_L': 0.2 + 1.5,\n                       'E_ex': 0.0,\n                       'E_in': -70.0,\n                       'V_reset': -60.0,\n                       'V_th': -51.0,\n                       't_ref': 2.0,\n                       'tau_syn_ex': 1.0,\n                       'tau_syn_in': 2.0,\n                       'I_e': 0.0,\n                       'V_m': -70.0})\n\n# !

Input generating nodes\n# ! ----------------------\n\n# ! Input is generated by sinusoidally modulate Poisson generators,\n# ! organized in a square layer of retina nodes. These nodes require a\n# ! slightly more complicated initialization than all other elements of\n# ! the network:\n# !\n# ! - Average firing rate ``rate``, firing rate modulation depth ``amplitude``,\n# !   and temporal modulation frequency ``frequency`` are the same for all\n# !   retinal nodes and are set directly below.\n# ! - The temporal phase ``phase`` of each node depends on its position in\n# !   the grating and can only be assigned after the retinal layer has\n# !   been created. We therefore specify a function for initalizing the\n# !   ``phase``. This function will be called for each node.\ndef phaseInit(pos, lam, alpha):\n    '''Initializer function for phase of drifting grating nodes.\n\n       pos  : position (x,y) of node, in degree\n       lam  : wavelength of grating, in degree\n       alpha: angle of grating in radian, zero is horizontal\n\n       Returns number to be used as phase of sinusoidal Poisson generator.\n    '''\n    return 360.0 / lam * (math.cos(alpha) * pos[0] + math.sin(alpha) * pos[1])\n\n\nnest.CopyModel('sinusoidal_poisson_generator', 'RetinaNode',\n               params={'amplitude': Params['retAC'],\n                       'rate': Params['retDC'],\n                       'frequency': Params['f_dg'],\n                       'phase': 0.0,\n                       'individual_spike_trains': False})\n\n# ! Recording nodes\n# ! ---------------\n\n# ! We use the new ``multimeter`` device for recording from the model\n# ! neurons. At present, ``iaf_cond_alpha`` is one of few models\n# ! supporting ``multimeter`` recording.  Support for more models will\n# ! be added soon; until then, you need to use ``voltmeter`` to record\n# ! from other models.\n# !\n# ! We configure multimeter to record membrane potential to membrane\n# ! potential at certain intervals to memory only. We record the GID of\n# ! the recorded neurons, but not the time.\nnest.CopyModel('multimeter', 'RecordingNode',\n               params={'interval': Params['sim_interval'],\n                       'record_from': ['V_m']\n})\n\n# ! Populations\n# ! ===========\n\n# ! We now create the neuron populations in the model, again in the\n# ! form of Python dictionaries. We define them in order from eye via\n# ! thalamus to cortex.\n# !\n# ! We first define a dictionary defining common properties for all\n# ! populations\nlayerProps = {'rows': Params['N'],\n              'columns': Params['N'],\n              'extent': [Params['visSize'], Params['visSize']],\n              'edge_wrap': True}\n# ! This dictionary does not yet specify the elements to put into the\n# ! layer, since they will differ from layer to layer. We will add them\n# ! below by updating the ``'elements'`` dictionary entry for each\n# ! population.\n\n# ! Retina\n# ! ------\nlayerProps.update({'elements': 'RetinaNode'})\nretina = topo.CreateLayer(layerProps)\n\n# retina_leaves is a work-around until NEST 3.0 is released\nretina_leaves = nest.GetLeaves(retina)[0]\n\n# ! Now set phases of retinal oscillators; we use a list comprehension instead\n# ! of a loop.\n[nest.SetStatus([n], {\"phase\": phaseInit(topo.GetPosition([n])[0],\n                                         Params[\"lambda_dg\"],\n                                         Params[\"phi_dg\"])})\n for n in retina_leaves]\n\n# ! Thalamus\n# ! --------\n\n# ! We first introduce specific neuron models for the thalamic relay\n# ! cells and interneurons. These have identical properties, but by\n# ! treating them as different models, we can address them specifically\n# ! when building connections.\n# !\n# ! We use a list comprehension to do the model copies.\n[nest.CopyModel('ThalamicNeuron', SpecificModel) for SpecificModel in\n ('TpRelay', 'TpInter')]\n\n# ! Now we can create the layer, with one relay cell and one\n# ! interneuron per location:\nlayerProps.update({'elements': ['TpRelay', 'TpInter']})\nTp = topo.CreateLayer(layerProps)\n\n# ! Reticular nucleus\n# ! -----------------\n# ! We follow the same approach as above, even though we have only a\n# ! single neuron in each location.\n[nest.CopyModel('ThalamicNeuron', SpecificModel) for SpecificModel in\n ('RpNeuron',)]\nlayerProps.update({'elements': 'RpNeuron'})\nRp = topo.CreateLayer(layerProps)\n\n# ! Primary visual cortex\n# ! ---------------------\n\n# ! We follow again the same approach. We differentiate neuron types\n# ! between layers and between pyramidal cells and interneurons. At\n# ! each location, there are two pyramidal cells and one interneuron in\n# ! each of layers 2-3, 4, and 5-6. Finally, we need to differentiate\n# ! between vertically and horizontally tuned populations. When creating\n# ! the populations, we create the vertically and the horizontally\n# ! tuned populations as separate populations.\n\n# ! We use list comprehesions to create all neuron types:\n[nest.CopyModel('CtxExNeuron', layer + 'pyr')\n for layer in ('L23', 'L4', 'L56')]\n[nest.CopyModel('CtxInNeuron', layer + 'in')\n for layer in ('L23', 'L4', 'L56')]\n\n# ! Now we can create the populations, suffixes h and v indicate tuning\nlayerProps.update({'elements': ['L23pyr', 2, 'L23in', 1,\n                                'L4pyr', 2, 'L4in', 1,\n                                'L56pyr', 2, 'L56in', 1]})\nVp_h = topo.CreateLayer(layerProps)\nVp_v = topo.CreateLayer(layerProps)\n\n# ! Collect all populations\n# ! -----------------------\n\n# ! For reference purposes, e.g., printing, we collect all populations\n# ! in a tuple:\npopulations = (retina, Tp, Rp, Vp_h, Vp_v)\n\n# ! Inspection\n# ! ----------\n\n# ! We can now look at the network using `PrintNetwork`:\nnest.PrintNetwork()\n\n# ! We can also try to plot a single layer in a network. For\n# ! simplicity, we use Rp, which has only a single neuron per position.\ntopo.PlotLayer(Rp)\npylab.title('Layer Rp')\npylab.show()\n\n# ! Synapse models\n# ! ==============\n\n# ! Actual synapse dynamics, e.g., properties such as the synaptic time\n# ! course, time constants, reversal potentials, are properties of\n# ! neuron models in NEST and we set them in section `Neuron models`_\n# ! above. When we refer to *synapse models* in NEST, we actually mean\n# ! connectors which store information about connection weights and\n# ! delays, as well as port numbers at the target neuron (``rport``)\n# ! and implement synaptic plasticity. The latter two aspects are not\n# ! relevant here.\n# !\n# ! We just use NEST's ``static_synapse`` connector but copy it to\n# ! synapse models ``AMPA`` and ``GABA_A`` for the sake of\n# ! explicitness. Weights and delays are set as needed in section\n# ! `Connections`_ below, as they are different from projection to\n# ! projection. De facto, the sign of the synaptic weight decides\n# ! whether input via a connection is handle by the ``_ex`` or the\n# ! ``_in`` synapse.\nnest.CopyModel('static_synapse', 'AMPA')\nnest.CopyModel('static_synapse', 'GABA_A')\n\n# ! Connections\n# ! ====================\n\n# ! Building connections is the most complex part of network\n# ! construction. Connections are specified in Table 1 in the\n# ! Hill-Tononi paper. As pointed out above, we only consider AMPA and\n# ! GABA_A synapses here.  Adding other synapses is tedious work, but\n# ! should pose no new principal challenges. We also use a uniform in\n# ! stead of a Gaussian distribution for the weights.\n# !\n# ! The model has two identical primary visual cortex populations,\n# ! ``Vp_v`` and ``Vp_h``, tuned to vertical and horizonal gratings,\n# ! respectively. The *only* difference in the connection patterns\n# ! between the two populations is the thalamocortical input to layers\n# ! L4 and L5-6 is from a population of 8x2 and 2x8 grid locations,\n# ! respectively. Furthermore, inhibitory connection in cortex go to\n# ! the opposing orientation population as to the own.\n# !\n# ! To save us a lot of code doubling, we thus defined properties\n# ! dictionaries for all connections first and then use this to connect\n# ! both populations. We follow the subdivision of connections as in\n# ! the Hill & Tononi paper.\n# !\n# ! **Note:** Hill & Tononi state that their model spans 8 degrees of\n# ! visual angle and stimuli are specified according to this. On the\n# ! other hand, all connection patterns are defined in terms of cell\n# ! grid positions. Since the NEST Topology Module defines connection\n# ! patterns in terms of the extent given in degrees, we need to apply\n# ! the following scaling factor to all lengths in connections:\ndpc = Params['visSize'] / (Params['N'] - 1)\n\n# ! We will collect all same-orientation cortico-cortical connections in\nccConnections = []\n# ! the cross-orientation cortico-cortical connections in\nccxConnections = []\n# ! and all cortico-thalamic connections in\nctConnections = []\n\n# ! Horizontal intralaminar\n# ! -----------------------\n# ! *Note:* \"Horizontal\" means \"within the same cortical layer\" in this\n# ! case.\n# !\n# ! We first define a dictionary with the (most) common properties for\n# ! horizontal intralaminar connection.
