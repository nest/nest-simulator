    Ensure that NEST triggers an error with a frozen multimeter connected to a node.

    This test has been modified to reflect that NEST now protects multimeter against being frozen.
    The first test triggers an error instead of an assertion, and crash_or_die has been replaced by fail_or_die.

    Remarks:
    This test has been modified (2011-02-11) to reflect the fact that NEST now protects
    multimeter against being frozen. Thus, the first test triggers an error instead of
    and assertion, and crash_or_die has been replaced by fail_or_die.
