def Connect(pre, post, conn_spec=None, syn_spec=None,

    """
    Connect `pre` nodes to `post` nodes.

    Nodes in `pre` and `post` are connected using the specified connectivity
    (`all-to-all` by default) and synapse type (:cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::static_synapse>` by default).
    Details depend on the connectivity rule.

    Lists of synapse models and connection rules are available as
    ``nest.synapse_models`` and ``nest.connection_rules``, respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pre : NodeCollection (or array-like object)
        Presynaptic nodes, as object representing the IDs of the nodes
    post : NodeCollection (or array-like object)
        Postsynaptic nodes, as object representing the IDs of the nodes

        Specifies synapse model, see below
    return_synapsecollection: bool
        Specifies whether or not we should return a :py:class:`.SynapseCollection` of pre and post connections

    Raises
    ------
    kernel.NESTError

    Notes
    -----
    It is possible to connect NumPy arrays of node IDs one-to-one by passing the arrays as `pre` and `post`,
    specifying `'one_to_one'` for `conn_spec`.
    In that case, the arrays may contain non-unique IDs.
    You may also specify weight, delay, and receptor type for each connection as NumPy arrays in the `syn_spec`
    dictionary.
    This feature is currently not available when MPI is used; trying to connect arrays with more than one
    MPI process will raise an error.

    If pre and post have spatial positions, a `mask` can be specified as a dictionary. The mask define which
    nodes are considered as potential targets for each source node. Connections with spatial nodes can also
    use `nest.spatial_distributions` as parameters, for instance for the probability `p`.

    **Connectivity specification (conn_spec)**

    Available rules and associated parameters::

     - 'all_to_all' (default)
     - 'one_to_one'
     - 'fixed_indegree', 'indegree'
     - 'fixed_outdegree', 'outdegree'
     - 'fixed_total_number', 'N'
     - 'pairwise_bernoulli', 'p'
     - 'symmetric_pairwise_bernoulli', 'p'

    See :ref:`conn_rules` for more details, including example usage.

    **Synapse specification (syn_spec)**

    The synapse model and its properties can be given either as a string
    identifying a specific synapse model (default: :cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::static_synapse>`) or
    as a dictionary specifying the synapse model and its parameters.

    Available keys in the synapse specification dictionary are::

     - 'synapse_model'
     - 'weight'
     - 'delay'
     - 'receptor_type'
     - any parameters specific to the selected synapse model.

    See :ref:`synapse_spec` for details, including example usage.

    All parameters are optional and if not specified, the default values
    of the synapse model will be used. The key 'synapse_model' identifies the
    synapse model, this can be one of NEST's built-in synapse models
    or a user-defined model created via :py:func:`.CopyModel`.

    If `synapse_model` is not specified the default model :cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::static_synapse>`
    will be used.

    Distributed parameters can be defined through NEST's different parametertypes. NEST has various
    random parameters, spatial parameters and distributions (only accessible for nodes with spatial positions),
    logical expressions and mathematical expressions, which can be used to define node and connection parameters.

    To see all available parameters, see documentation defined in distributions, logic, math,
    random and spatial modules.

    rule (one-to-one by default) and synapse type (:cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::static_synapse>` by default).

    ----------

    syn_spec : str or dict
        Synapse specifications when specifying pre- and postsynaptic nodes, see below

    Notes
    -------

    **conn_spec**

    Apply the same rules as for connectivity specs in the :py:func:`.Connect` method

    Possible choices of the conn_spec are
    ::
     - 'one_to_one'
     - 'all_to_all'

    **syn_spec**

    The synapse model and its properties can be specified either as a string naming
    a synapse model (the list of all available synapse models can be gotten via
    ``nest.synapse_models``) or as a dictionary as described below.

    Note that only the synapse type is checked when we disconnect and that if
    `syn_spec` is given as a non-empty dictionary, the 'synapse_model' parameter must
    be present.

    If no synapse model is specified the default model
    :cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::static_synapse>` will be used.

    Available keys in the synapse dictionary are:
    ::

    - 'synapse_model'
    - 'weight'
    - 'delay',
    - 'receptor_type'
    - parameters specific to the synapse model chosen

    'synapse_model' determines the synapse type, taken from pre-defined synapse
    types in NEST or manually specified synapses created via :py:func:`.CopyModel`.

    All other parameters are not currently implemented.

    -----
    `Disconnect` only disconnects explicitly specified nodes.
