The membrane potential as well as the spiking activity are\nrecorded by corresponding devices.\n\nIt can be observed how the current charges the membrane, a spike\nis emitted, the neuron becomes absolute refractory, and finally\nstarts to recover.\n\nReferences\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSee Also\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n:Authors:\n\nKEYWORDS:\n"
