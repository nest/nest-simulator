Name: stop - raise a stop signal

Synopsis:

stop ->	- 
Desctiption: 
stop causes the execution stack to be popped until an 
enclosing stopped context is found. Effectively, the 
stopped/stop combination equals the catch/throw pair of 
C++. 
stop/stopped is used to implement SLI's error handling 
capabilities. 
Notes: stop, stopped is PostScript compatible.
