Part 3: Connecting networks with synapses
=========================================

Introduction
------------

In this section we look at using synapse models to connect neurons.
After you have worked through this material, you will know how to:

-  set synapse model parameters before creation
-  define synapse models with customised parameters
-  use synapse models in connection routines
-  query the synapse values after connection
-  set synapse values during and after connection

For more information on the usage of PyNEST, please see the other
sections of this primer:

-  :ref:`Part 1: Neurons and simple neural
   networks <pynest_tutorial_1>`
-  :ref:`Part 2: Populations of neurons <pynest_tutorial_2>`
-  :ref:`Part 4: Spatially structured
   networks <pynest_tutorial_4>`

More advanced examples can be found at :ref:`Example
Networks <pynest_examples>`, or
have a look at at the source directory of your NEST installation in the
subdirectory: ``pynest/examples/``.

Parametrizing synapse models
-----------------------------

NEST provides a variety of different synapse models. You can see the
available models by using the command ``Models(synapses)``, which picks
only the synapse models out of the list of all available models.

Synapse models can be parameterised analogously to neuron models. You
can discover the default parameter settings using ``GetDefaults(model)``
and set them with ``SetDefaults(model,params)``:

::

    nest.SetDefaults("stdp_synapse",{"tau_plus": 15.0})

Any synapse generated from this model will then have all the standard
parameters except for the ``tau_plus``, which will have the value given
above.

Moreover, we can also create customised variants of synapse models using
:py:func:`.CopyModel`, exactly as demonstrated for neuron models:

::

    nest.CopyModel("stdp_synapse","layer1_stdp_synapse",{"Wmax": 90.0})

Now ``layer1_stdp_synapse`` will appear in the list returned by
:py:func:`.Models`, and can be used anywhere that a built-in model name can be
used.

STDP synapses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the majority of synapses, all of their parameters are accessible via
:py:func:`.GetDefaults` and :py:func:`.SetDefaults`. Synapse models implementing
spike-timing dependent plasticity are an exception to this, as their
dynamics are driven by the postsynaptic :hxt_ref:`spike train` as well as the
pre-synaptic one. As a consequence, the time constant of the depressing
window of :hxt_ref:`STDP` is a parameter of the postsynaptic neuron. It can be set
as follows:

::

    nest.Create("iaf_psc_alpha", params={"tau_minus": 30.0})

or by using any of the other methods of parametrizing neurons
demonstrated in the first two parts of this introduction.

Connecting with synapse models
------------------------------

The synapse model as well as parameters associated with the synapse type
can be set in the synapse specification dictionary accepted by the
connection routine.

::

    conn_dict = {"rule": "fixed_indegree", "indegree": K}
    syn_dict = {"synapse_model": "stdp_synapse", "alpha": 1.0}
    nest.Connect(epop1, epop2, conn_dict, syn_dict)

If no synapse model is given, connections are made using the model
:hxt_ref:`static_synapse`.

Distributing synapse parameters
-------------------------------

The synapse parameters are specified in the synapse dictionary which is
passed to the :py:func:`.Connect`-function. If the parameter is set to a scalar
all connections will be drawn using the same parameter. Parameters can
be randomly distributed by passing a NEST Parameter object. The Parameter object
can be combined to create a more complex parameter. Optionally,
parameters associated with the distribution can be set (for example
``mean``). Here we show an example where the parameters ``alpha`` and
``weight`` of the stdp synapse are uniformly distributed.

::

    alpha_min = 0.1
    alpha_max = 2.
    w_min = 0.5
    w_max = 5.

    syn_dict = {"synapse_model": "stdp_synapse",
                "alpha": nest.random.uniform(min=alpha_min, max=alpha_max),
                "weight": nest.random.uniform(min=w_min, max=w_max),
                "delay": 1.0}
    nest.Connect(epop1, neuron, "all_to_all", syn_dict)

Available distributions and associated parameters are described in
:ref:`Connection Managementi <connection_management>`, the most common
ones are:

+-------------------+------------------------+
| Distributions     | Keys                   |
+===================+========================+
| `normal`          | `mean`, `std`          |
+-------------------+------------------------+
| `lognormal`       | `mean`, `std`          |
+-------------------+------------------------+
| `uniform`         | `min`, `max`           |
+-------------------+------------------------+
| `exponential`     | `beta`                 |
+-------------------+------------------------+
| `gamma`           | `kappa`, `theta`       |
+-------------------+------------------------+

Querying the synapses
---------------------

The function
``GetConnections(source=None, target=None, synapse_model=None)`` returns
a `SynapseCollection` representing connection identifiers that match the given specifications.
There are no mandatory arguments. If it is called without any arguments,
it will return all the connections in the network. If ``source`` is
specified, as a NodeCollection of one or more nodes, the function will return all
outgoing connections from that population:

::

    nest.GetConnections(epop1)

Similarly, we can find the incoming connections of a particular target
population by specifying ``target`` as a NodeCollection of one or more nodes:

::

    nest.GetConnections(target=epop2)

will return all connections between all neurons in the network and
neurons in ``epop2``. Finally, the search can be restricted by
specifying a given synapse model:

::

    nest.GetConnections(synapse_model="stdp_synapse")

will return all the connections in the network which are of type
:hxt_ref:`stdp_synapse`. The last two cases are slower than the first case, as
a full search of all connections has to be performed. The arguments
``source``, ``target`` and ``synapse_model`` can be used individually,
as above, or in any conjunction:

::

    nest.GetConnections(epop1, epop2, "stdp_synapse")

will return all the connections that the neurons in ``epop1`` have to
neurons in ``epop2`` of type :hxt_ref:`stdp_synapse`. Note that all these
querying commands will only return the local connections, i.e. those
represented on that particular :hxt_ref:`MPI` process in a distributed simulation.

Once we have the SynapseCollection of connections, we can extract data from it using
:py:meth:`~.SynapseCollection.get`. In the simplest case, this returns a dictionary of lists,
containing the parameters and variables for each
connection found by :py:func:`.GetConnections`. However, usually we don't want
all the information from a synapse, just some specific part of it. For
example, if we want to check that we have connected the network as intended,
we might want to examine only the parameter ``target`` of each
connection. We can extract just this information by using the optional
``keys`` argument of ``get()``:

::

    conns = nest.GetConnections(epop1, synapse_model="stdp_synapse")
    targets = conns.get("target")

The variable ``targets`` is now a list of all the ``target`` values of the
connections found. If we are interested in more than one parameter,
``keys`` can be a list of keys as well:

::

    conns = nest.GetConnections(epop1, synapse_model="stdp_synapse")
    conn_vals = conns.get(["target","weight"])

The variable ``conn_vals`` is now a dictionary of lists, containing the
``target`` and ``weight`` values for each connection found.

To get used to these methods of querying the synapses, it is recommended
to try them out on a small network where all connections are known.

Coding style
------------

As your simulations become more complex, it is very helpful to develop a
clean coding style. This reduces the number of errors in the first
place, but also assists you to debug your code and makes it easier for
others to understand it (or even yourself after two weeks). Here are
some pointers, some of which are common to programming in general and
some of which are more NEST specific. Another source of useful advice is
`PEP-8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__, which,
conveniently, can be automatically checked by many editors and IDEs.

Numbers and variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simulations typically have lots of numbers in them - we use them to set
parameters for neuron models, to define the strengths of connections,
the length of simulations and so on. Sometimes we want to use the same
parameters in different scripts, or calculate some parameters based on
the values of other parameters. It is not recommended to hardwire the
numbers into your scripts, as this is error-prone: if you later decide
to change the value of a given parameter, you have to go through all
your code and check that you have changed every instance of it. This is
particularly difficult to catch if the value is being used in different
contexts, for example to set a weight in one place and to calculate the
mean synaptic input in another.

A better approach is to set a variable to your parameter value, and then
always use the variable name every time the value is needed. It is also
hard to follow the code if the definitions of variables are spread
throughout the script. If you have a parameters section in your script,
and group the variable names according to function (e.g. neuronal
parameters, synaptic parameters, stimulation parameters,...) then it is
much easier to find and check them. Similarly, if you need to share
parameters between simulation scripts, it is much less error-prone to
define all the variable names in a separate parameters file, which the
individual scripts can import. Thus a good rule of thumb is that numbers
should only be visible in distinct parameter files or parameter
sections, otherwise they should be represented by variables.

Repetitive code, copy-and-paste, functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often you need to repeat a section of code with minor modifications. For
example, you have two :hxt_ref:`multimeter`\ s and you wish to extract the
recorded variable from each of them and then calculate its maximum. The
temptation is to write the code once, then copy-and-paste it to its new
location and make any necessary modifications:

::

    dma = ma.get("events")
    Vma = dma["V_m"]
    amax = max(Vma)
    dmb = mb.get("events")
    Vmb = dmb["V_m"]
    bmax = max(Vmb)
    print(amax-bmax)

There are two problems with this. First, it makes the main section of
your code longer and harder to follow. Secondly, it is error-prone. A
certain percentage of the time you will forget to make all the necessary
modifications after the copy-and-paste, and this will introduce errors
into your code that are hard to find, not only because they are
semantically correct and so don't cause an obvious error, but also
because your eye tends to drift over them:

::

    dma = multimeter1.get("events")
    Vma = dma["V_m"]
    amax = max(Vma)
    dmb = multimeter2.get("events")
    Vmb = dmb["V_m"]
    bmax = max(Vma)
    print(amax-bmax)

The best way to avoid this is to define a function:

::

    def getMaxMemPot(Vdevice):
        dm = Vdevice.get("events")
        return max(dm["V_m"])

Such helper functions can usefully be stored in their own section,
analogous to the parameters section. Now we can write down the
functionality in a more concise and less error-prone fashion:

::

    amax = getMaxMemPot(multimeter1)
    bmax = getMaxMemPot(multimeter2)
    print(amax-bmax)

If you find that this clutters your code, as an alternative you can
write a ``lambda`` function as an argument for ``map``, and enjoy the
feeling of smugness that will pervade the rest of your day. A good
policy is that if you find yourself about to copy-and-paste more than
one line of code, consider taking the few extra seconds required to
define a function. You will easily win this time back by spending less
time looking for errors.

Subsequences and loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When preparing a simulation or collecting or analysing data, it commonly
happens that we need to perform the same operation on each node (or a
subset of nodes) in a population. To get a subsequence of nodes, use a
*slice* of the relevant population:

::

    nest.Connect(neuronpop[:Nrec],spikerecorder,"all_to_all")

One thing you should not do is to use your knowledge about neuron ids to set up
loops:

::

    for n in range(1,len(neuronpop)+1):
        nest.SetStatus(NodeCollection([n]), {"V_m": -67.0})

Not only is this error prone, the majority of
PyNEST functions are expecting a :py:class:`.NodeCollection` anyway. If you give them a NodeCollection,
you are reducing the complexity of your main script (good) and pushing
the loop down to the faster C++ kernel, where it will run more quickly
(also good). Therefore, instead you should write:

::

    nest.SetStatus(neuronpop, {"V_m": -67.0})

or, even better

::

    neuronpop.set(V_m=-67.0)

:ref:`See Part 2 <pynest_tutorial_2>` for more examples on
operations on multiple neurons, such as setting the status from a random
distribution and connecting populations.

If you really really need to loop over neurons, just loop over the
population itself (or a slice of it) rather than introducing ranges:

::

    for n in neuronpop:
        my_weird_function(n)

Thus we can conclude: instead of range operations, use slices of and
loops over the neuronal population itself. In the case of loops, check
first whether you can avoid it entirely by passing the entire population
into the function - you usually can.

Command overview
----------------

These are the new functions we introduced for the examples in this
handout.

Querying Synapses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``GetConnections(neuron, synapse_model="None"))``

   Return a SynapseCollection of connection identifiers.

   Parameters:

   -  ``source`` - NodeCollection of source node IDs
   -  ``target`` - NodeCollection of target node IDs
   -  ``synapse_model`` - string with the synapse model

   If GetConnections is called without parameters, all connections in
   the network are returned. If a NodeCollection of source neurons is given, only
   connections from these pre-synaptic neurons are returned. If a NodeCollection
   of target neurons is given, only connections to these postsynaptic
   neurons are returned. If a synapse model is given, only connections
   with this synapse type are returned. Any combination of source,
   target and synapse\_model parameters is permitted. Each connection id
   is represented by the following five
   entries: source-node_id, target-node_id, target-thread, synapse-id, port

   *Note:* Only connections with targets on the :hxt_ref:`MPI` process executing
   the command are returned.
