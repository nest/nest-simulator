Name: testsuite::test_voltmeter_reset - test if resetting works on voltmeter

Synopsis:

(test_voltmeter_reset) run -> dies if assertion fails


Description:

Voltmeter records from iaf_neuron to memory, checks if proper number 
of data points is acquired, deleted on reset, and recorded again on 
further simulation. This test ascertains that also data stored in the 
derived recorder class, not only in RecordingDevice, is reset.
