/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_multimeter_support - test if multimeter support works in neurons

Synopsis: (test_multimeter_support.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails

Description:
The script checks all modes providing a "recordables" entry in their status dict.
It creates a multimeter, sets it to record from all recordables and checks whether
the correct amount of data is collected. It does not check the content of the data
collected.
