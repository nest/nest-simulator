% by a restart of NEST with a serial binary.
% The commented code below is the real one.

% At this point nest is serial 
% Therefore, we can now do the test.

% the following call shall pass without error:
{ 1 0 add } passorfailbutnocrash_or_die  % code passes
{ 1 0 div } passorfailbutnocrash_or_die  % code fails

% the following crashes and NEST should exit with code 3
