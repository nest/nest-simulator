Name: testsuite::test_multithreading - sli script for several tests regarding multithreading

Synopsis:

(test_multithreading) run


Description:

This is a simple testscript to test if multithreading is working 
correctly. The following things are tested: 
* Does setting the number of threads to x result in x threads? 
* Does ResetKernel reset the number of threads to 1? 
* Does default node distribution (modulo) work as expected? 
The data collection over threads is tested in a separate script. See 
SeeAlso key below.
