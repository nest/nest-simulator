    gif_cond_exp_multisynapse - Conductance-based generalized  
      integrate-and-fire neuron model with multiple synaptic time constants  
      according to Mensi et al. (2012) and Pozzorini et al. (2015).

**Description:**
::

     
       
      gif_cond_exp_multisynapse is the generalized integrate-and-fire neuron  
      according to Mensi et al. (2012) and Pozzorini et al. (2015), with  
      post-synaptic conductances in the form of truncated exponentials.  
       
      This model features both an adaptation current and a dynamic threshold for  
      spike-frequency adaptation. The membrane potential (V) is described by the  
      differential equation:  
       
      C*dV(t)/dt = -g_L*(V(t)-E_L)  - eta_1(t)  - eta_2(t)  - ...   - eta_n(t) + I(t)  
       
      where each eta_i is a spike-triggered current (stc), and the neuron model can  
      have arbitrary number of them.  
      Dynamic of each eta_i is described by:  
       
      tau_eta_i*d{eta_i}/dt = -eta_i  
       
      and in case of spike emission, its value increased by a constant (which can be  
      positive or negative):  
       
      eta_i = eta_i + q_eta_i  (in case of spike emission).  
       
      Neuron produces spikes STOCHASTICALLY according to a point process with the  
      firing intensity:  
       
      lambda(t) = lambda_0 * exp[ (V(t)-V_T(t)) / Delta_V ]  
       
      where V_T(t) is a time-dependent firing threshold:  
       
      V_T(t) = V_T_star + gamma_1(t) + gamma_2(t) + ... + gamma_m(t)  
       
      where gamma_i is a kernel of spike-frequency adaptation (sfa), and the neuron  
      model can have arbitrary number of them.  
      Dynamic of each gamma_i is described by:  
       
      tau_gamma_i*d{gamma_i}/dt = -gamma_i  
       
      and in case of spike emission, its value increased by a constant (which can be  
      positive or negative):  
       
      gamma_i = gamma_i + q_gamma_i  (in case of spike emission).  
       
      Note that in the current implementation of the model (as described in [1] and  
      [2]) the values of eta_i and gamma_i are affected immediately after spike  
      emission. However, GIF toolbox (http://wiki.epfl.ch/giftoolbox) which fits  
      the model using experimental data, requires a different set of eta_i and  
      gamma_i. It applies the jump of eta_i and gamma_i after the refractory period.  
      One can easily convert between q_eta/gamma of these two approaches:  
      q_eta_giftoolbox = q_eta_NEST * (1 - exp( -tau_ref / tau_eta ))  
      The same formula applies for q_gamma.  
       
      On the postsynapic side, there can be arbitrarily many synaptic time constants  
      (gif_psc_exp has exactly two: tau_syn_ex and tau_syn_in). This can be reached  
      by specifying separate receptor ports, each for a different time constant. The  
      port number has to match the respective "receptor_type" in the connectors.  
       
      The shape of synaptic conductance is exponential.  
       
      

**Parameters:**
::

     
      C_m     double - Capacity of the membrane in pF  
      t_ref   double - Duration of refractory period in ms.  
      V_reset   double - Reset value after a spike in mV.  
      E_L   double - Leak reversal potential in mV.  
      g_L     double - Leak conductance in nS.  
      I_e    double - Constant external input current in pA.  
       
      Spike adaptation and firing intensity parameters:  
      q_stc     vector of double   - Values added to spike-triggered currents (stc)  
      after each spike emission in nA.  
      tau_stc   vector of double    - Time constants of stc variables in ms.  
      q_sfa   vector of double   - Values added to spike-frequency adaptation  
      (sfa) after each spike emission in mV.  
      tau_sfa   vector of double  - Time constants of sfa variables in ms.  
      Delta_V   double   - Stochasticity level in mV.

      Synaptic parameters  
      tau_syn   double vector  - Time constants of the synaptic conductance  
      in ms (same size as E_rev).  
      E_rev   double vector  - Reversal potentials in mV (same size as tau_syn).  
       
      Integration parameters  
      gsl_error_tol  double    - This parameter controls the admissible error of the  
      GSL integrator. Reduce it if NEST complains about  
      numerical instabilities.  
       
      Example:  
       
      neuron = nest.Create('gif_cond_exp_multisynapse',  
      params={'E_rev': [0.0, -85.0],  
      'tau_syn': [4.0, 8.0]})  
       
      spike = nest.Create('spike_generator', params={'spike_times':  
      np.array([10.0])})  
       
      delays = [1., 30.]  
      w = [1., 5.]  
      for syn in range(2):  
      nest.Connect(spike, neuron, syn_spec={'model': 'static_synapse',  
      'receptor_type': 1 + syn,  
      'weight': w[syn],  
      'delay': delays[syn]})  
      nest.Simulate(100.)
