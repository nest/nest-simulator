Name: testsuite::test_goodhandler - test if SLI returns exit code 0 when an error is handled by a correct user error handler.

Synopsis:

(test_goodhandler) run ->


Description:

This script establishes a user error handler and then provokes an 
error. The error handler resets errodict::newerror to false. This is 
a dumb, but correct way of handling errors. NEST should pass this 
scipt and return exit code 0.
