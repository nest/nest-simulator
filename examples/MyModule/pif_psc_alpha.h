Name: pif_psc_alpha - Perfect integrate-and-fire neuron model with alpha PSC
                      synapse.

Description:
pif_psc_alpha implements a non-leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with
with alpha-function shaped synaptic currents. The threshold crossing is
followed by an absolute refractory period during which the membrane potential
is clamped to the resting potential, while synaptic currents evolve normally.

The dynamics of the neuron are defined by

   C_m dV/dt  = I_syn(t) + I_e

   I_syn(t)   = Sum_{t_{j,k} < t} w_j x (t-t_{j,k}) x e/tau_syn x
                                                        e^{-(t-t_{j,k})/tau_syn}

where t_{j,k} is the time of the k-th spike arriving from neuron j, and w_j is
the weight of the synapse from neuron j onto the present neuron. The alpha
function is normalized by amplitude, i.e., the maximum input current for any
spike is w_j.

Parameters:
C_m      double - Membrane capacitance, in pF
I_e      double - Intrinsic DC current, in nA
tau_syn  double - Synaptic time constant, in ms
t_ref    double - Duration of refractory period in ms.
V_th     double - Spike threshold in mV.
V_reset  double - Reset potential of the membrane in mV.

Remarks:
The linear subthresold dynamics is integrated by the Exact
Integration scheme [1]. The neuron dynamics is solved on the time
grid given by the computation step size. Incoming as well as emitted
spikes are forced to that grid.
