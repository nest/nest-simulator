    Name: testsuite::test_fixed_indegree - Test correct connection with many targets
    Synopsis: (test_fixed_indegree) run -> -

    Description:
    test_fixed_indegree.sli checks that all-to-all connections are created
    correctly if the number of targets exceeds the number of local nodes.

/unittest using

% With one MPI process, conventional looping is used. For 4 processes, we will
% have fewer local nodes than targets and inverse looping is used. Due to
% randomness, we cannot expect identical results, but we can check the number
% of connections in total.
