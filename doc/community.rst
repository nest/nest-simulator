NEST Community
===============


Mailing List
-------------

The NEST User Mailing list is intended to be a forum for questions on the usage 
of NEST, the exchange of code and general discussions about NEST. The philosophy 
is that all users profit by sharing their experience. All NEST core developers 
are subscribed to this list and will participate in the discussions as far as 
time allows.
