   Name: testsuite::test_copymodel - sli script to test if CopyModel works as expected

   Synopsis: (test_copymodel) run

   Description:
   This test generates several copies of node and synapse models, sets
   their parameters and compares the results for consistency.

   SeeAlso: CopyModel, GetDefaults, SetDefaults
