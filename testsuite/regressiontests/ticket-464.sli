Name: testsuite::ticket-464 - Ensure that UniversalDataLogger triggers assertion with frozen multimeter.

Synopsis: (ticket-464) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
Ensure that NEST triggers an assertion in UniversalDataLogger::record_data() instead of seg faulting
when a frozen multimeter is connected to a node.

Remarks:
This test has been modified (2011-02-11) to reflect the fact that NEST now protects
multimeter against being frozen. Thus, the first test triggers an error instead of
and assertion, and crash_or_die has been replaced by fail_or_die.

This test will only be executed if NEST has been compiled without MPI support.
