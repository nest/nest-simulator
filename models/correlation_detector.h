Short description
+++++++++++++++++

Device for evaluating cross correlation between two spike sources

Description
+++++++++++

The ``correlation_detector`` is a device that receives spikes from two pools of
spike inputs and calculates the ``count_histogram`` of inter-spike intervals
(raw cross correlation) binned to bins of duration :math:`\delta_\tau`.
The corresponding parameter ``delta_tau`` defaults to 5 times the simulation
resolution.

The result can be obtained from the node's status dictionary under the key
``count_histogram``.

In parallel it records a weighted histogram, where the connection weights
are used to weight every count. In order to minimize numerical errors, the
`Kahan summation algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm>`_
is used when calculating the weighted histogram.
Both are arrays of :math:`2\cdot\tau_{max}/\delta_{\tau}+1` values containing the
histogram counts in the following way:

Let :math:`t_{1,i}` be the spike times of source 1,
:math:`t_{2,j}` the spike times of source 2.
``histogram[n]`` then contains the sum of products of the weight
:math:`w_{1,i}\cdot w_{2,j}`, count_histogram[n] contains 1 summed over all events
with :math:`t_{2,j}-t_{1,i}` in

.. math::

    n\cdot\delta_\tau - \tau_{max} - \delta_\tau/2
    n\cdot\delta_\tau - \tau_{max} + \delta_\tau/2

The bins are centered around the time difference they represent, but are
left-closed and right-open. This means that events with time difference
:math:`-\tau_{max}-\delta_\tau/2` are counted in the leftmost bin, but event with
difference :math:`\tau_{max}+\delta_\tau/2` are not counted at all.

The correlation detector has two inputs, which are selected via the
receptor_port of the incoming connection: All incoming connections with
``receptor_port = 0`` will be pooled as the spike source 1, the ones with
``receptor_port = 1`` will be used as spike source 2.

Correlation detectors ignore any connection delays.

See :doc:`../auto_examples/cross_check_mip_corrdet` to learn more
about the usage of the correlation detector.

Parameters
++++++++++

==================== ======== ==================================================
Tstart               real     Time when to start counting events. This time
should
                              be set to at least start + tau_max in order to
avoid
                              edge effects of the correlation counts.
Tstop                real     Time when to stop counting events. This time
should
                              be set to at most Tsim - tau_max, where Tsim is
the
                              duration of simulation, in order to avoid edge
                              effects of the correlation counts.
delta_tau            ms       Bin width. This has to be an odd multiple of
                              the resolution, to allow the symmetry between
                              positive and negative time-lags. Defaults to 5
                              times the simulation resolution
tau_max              ms       One-sided width. In the lower triangular part
                              events with differences in [0, tau_max+delta_tau/2)
                              are counted. On the diagonal and in the upper
                              triangular part events with differences in
                              (0, tau_max+delta_tau/2]. Defaults to 10 times the
                              value of delta_tau.
N_channels           integer  The number of pools. This defines the range of
                              receptor_type. Default is 1.
                              Setting N_channels clears count_covariance,
                              covariance and n_events.
histogram            squared  read-only - raw, weighted, cross-correlation
counts
                     synaptic Unit depends on model
                     weights
histogram_correction list of  read-only - Correction factors for Kahan summation
                     integers algoritm
n_events             list of  Number of events from source 0 and 1. By setting
                     integers n_events to [0,0], the histogram is cleared.

 * - incoming_ is vector of two deques
 * - let handle() push_back() entries in incoming_ and do nothing else
 * - keep index to last "old spike" in each incoming_; cannot

 * - update() deletes all entries before now-tau_max, sorts the new
