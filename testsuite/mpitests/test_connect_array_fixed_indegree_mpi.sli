/** @BeginDocumentation
   Name: testsuite::test_connect_array_fixed_indegree_mpi - SLI script to test connection with parameter arrays and connection rule fixed_indegree, with hybrid MPI and thread parallelism

   Synopsis: (test_connect_array_fixed_indegree_mpi) run

   Description:

   Tests with hybrid MPI and thread parallelism the possibility to use
   parameter arrays to define connection weights and/or delays in conjunction
   with the connection rules fixed_indegree

   FirstVersion: August 2016
