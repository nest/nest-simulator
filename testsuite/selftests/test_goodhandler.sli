/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_goodhandler - test if SLI returns exit code 0 when an error is handled by a correct user error handler.

Synopsis: (test_goodhandler) run ->

Description:
This script establishes a user error handler and then provokes an
error. The error handler resets errodict::newerror to false. This is
a dumb, but correct way of handling errors. NEST should pass this
scipt and return exit code 0.
