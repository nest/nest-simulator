Name: testsuite::test_gsd_distribution - Test global spike detector with pure MPI parallelism

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_gsd_distribution.sli -> -

Description:
Tests if global spike detectors are equally distributed among virtual
recording processes. The script creates 6 Spike detectors on 1,2 and 3
recording processes, respectively, and checks if they are equally
distributed.
