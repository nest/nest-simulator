Using CSA for connection setup
------------------------------

This example sets up a simple network in NEST using the Connection Set
Algebra (CSA) instead of using the built-in connection routines.

Using the CSA requires NEST to be compiled with support for
libneurosim. For details, see Djurfeldt M, Davison AP and Eppler JM
(2014) **Efficient generation of connectivity in neuronal networks
from simulator-independent descriptions**, *Front. Neuroinform.*
http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2014.00043

"""
First, we import all necessary modules for simulation and plotting.
"""

import nest
from nest import voltage_trace
from nest import visualization

"""
Next, we check for the availability of the CSA Python module. If it
does not import, we exit with an error message.
"""

    import csa

"""
To set up the connectivity, We create a ``random`` connection set
with a probability of 0.1 and two associated values (10000.0 and 1.0)
used as weight and delay, respectively.
"""

cs = csa.cset(csa.random(0.1), 10000.0, 1.0)

"""
Using the `Create` command from PyNEST, we create the neurons of
the pre- and postsynaptic populations, each of which containing 16
neurons.
"""

pre = nest.Create("iaf_psc_alpha", 16)
post = nest.Create("iaf_psc_alpha", 16)

"""
We can now connect the populations using the `CGConnect` function.
It takes the IDs of pre- and postsynaptic neurons (``pre`` and
``post``), the connection set (``cs``) and a dictionary that maps
the parameters weight and delay to positions in the value set
associated with the connection set.
"""

nest.CGConnect(pre, post, cs, {"weight": 0, "delay": 1})

"""
To stimulate the network, we create a `poisson_generator` and set it
up to fire with a rate of 100000 spikes per second. It is connected to
the neurons of the pre-synaptic population.
"""

pg = nest.Create("poisson_generator", params={"rate": 100000.0})
nest.Connect(pg, pre, "all_to_all")

"""
To measure and record the membrane potentials of the neurons, we
create a `voltmeter` and connect it to all post-synaptic nodes.
"""

vm = nest.Create("voltmeter")
nest.Connect(vm, post, "all_to_all")

"""
We save the whole connection graph of the network as a PNG image
using the `plot_network` function of the `visualization` submodule of
PyNEST.
"""

allnodes = pg + pre + post + vm
visualization.plot_network(allnodes, "csa_example_graph.png")

"""
Finally, we simulate the network for 50 ms. The voltage traces of
the post-synaptic nodes are plotted.
