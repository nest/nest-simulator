Installation
============

Introduction
------------

NEST compiles and runs on most Unix-like operating systems including Linux and Mac OS X. For using NEST on Microsoft Windows, see [below](#Windows). The installation instructions here should work on all recent versions of Debian or Ubuntu. For more generic installation instructions, see the files README and INSTALL in the top source directory.

Following are the basic steps to compile and install NEST from source code:

1.  [Download NEST](download.md "Download")
2.  Unpack the tarball: `tar -xzvf nest-x.y.z.tar.gz`
3.  Create a build directory: `mkdir nest-x.y.z-build`
4.  Change to the build directory: `cd nest-x.y.z-build`
5.  Configure NEST: `../nest-x.y.z/configure` with appropriate configuration options (**prefix**, etc.)
6.  Compile by running `make`
7.  Install by running `make install`
8.  See the [Getting started](http://www.nest-simulator.org/getting_started/ "Getting started") pages to find out how to get going with NEST

Please see the sections on [minimal](#Minimal_configuration) and [standard configuration](installation.md#Standard_configuration "Installation") below for details.

What gets installed where?
--------------------------

By default, everything will be installed to the subdirectories `$PREFIX/{bin,lib,share}`, where `$PREFIX=$HOME/opt/nest`:

Executables   
`$PREFIX/bin`

Extensions   
`$PREFIX/lib/nest`

SLI libraries   
`$PREFIX/share/nest/sli`

Documentation   
`$PREFIX/share/doc/nest`

Examples   
`$PREFIX/share/doc/nest/examples`

PyNEST   
`$PREFIX/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/nest`

PyNEST examples   
`$PREFIX/share/doc/nest/examples/pynest`

Extras   
`$PREFIX/share/nest/extras/emacs/sli`

You can supply a custom prefix using the `--prefix=$PREFIX` switch for `./configure`. In this case, you have to add the installation directory to your search paths. For example, if you are using bash:

``` {.prettyprint}
export PATH=$PATH:$PREFIX/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PREFIX/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
```

Dependencies
------------

NEST needs a few third party tools and libraries to work. On many operating systems, these can be installed using a *package manager* like `apt`, `port` or `fink` (see [Standard configuration](installation.md#Standard_configuration "Software:Installation")).

If you are building NEST from the SVN sources, you need the GNU autotools installed on your system to bootstrap the build system. These consist of

-   autoconf
-   automake
-   libtool
-   libltdl

The [GNU readline library](http://www.gnu.org/software/readline/) is recommended if you use NEST interactively without Python. Although most Linux distributions have GNU readline installed, you still need to install its development package if want to use GNU readline with NEST. GNU readline itself depends on [libncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) (or libtermcap on older systems). Again, the development packages are needed to compile NEST.

The [GNU Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) is needed by several neuron models, in particular those with conductance based synapses. If you want these models, please install the GNU Scientific Library along with its development packages. We strongly recommend that you install/update to GNU Scientific Library v1.11 or later.

If you want to use PyNEST, we recommend to install the following along with their development packages:

-   Python (<http://www.python.org/download>)
-   NumPy (<http://www.scipy.org/Download>)
-   SciPy (<http://www.scipy.org/Download>)
-   matplotlib (<http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>)
-   IPython (<http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Download>)

Additionally, NEST depends on a few POSIX libraries which are usually present on all UNIX like operating systems (Linux, Mac OS), so don't worry. But if you wonder why NEST is difficult to compile on Windows, it is because of these:

-   libpthread, for threading support
-   libregexp, for regular expressions.

Minimal configuration
---------------------

NEST can be compiled without any external packages; such configuration may be useful e.g. for initial porting to a new supercomputer. However, this implies several restrictions: First, some neuron and synapse models will not be available, as they depend on ODE solvers from the GNU scientific library. Second, the Python extension will not be available, and third, multi-threading and parallel computing facilities will be disabled.

To compile NEST without external packages, use the following command line to configure it:

``` {.prettyprint}
tar -xzvf nest-x.y.z.tar.gz

mkdir nest-x.y.z-build
cd nest-x.y.z-build

../nest-x.y.z/configure
    --prefix=$HOME/opt/nest
    --without-python
    --without-readline
    --without-pthread
```

Standard configuration
----------------------

To install the packages required for the standard installation use the following command line:

``` {.prettyprint}
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool libltdl7-dev
libreadline6-dev libncurses5-dev libgsl0-dev python-all-dev python-numpy python-scipy
python-matplotlib ipython
```

Then configure NEST using:

``` {.prettyprint}
 ../nest-x.y.z/configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/nest
```

Choice of compiler
------------------

**Caveat:** you should compile NEST with the same compiler and version as your Python. Strange crashes have been observed on importing NEST when compiling NEST with g++ 4.3 or later on OS X and importing it into Python compiled with the standard GCC 4.0 compiler. Most NEST developers use the GNU gcc/g++ compilers. We also regularly compile NEST using the Intel icc/icpc compilers and the IBM xlc/xlC compilers. You can find the version of your compiler by, e.g.,

``` {.prettyprint}
 g++ -v
```

Python displays the compiler used to build it at startup.

### Compiler-specific options

NEST is pre-configured with a reasonable set of compiler options for the most common compilers.

When compiling with the Portland compiler, use the -Kieee flag to ensure that computations obey the IEEE754 standard for floating point numerics.

Configuration options
---------------------

If you need special features, like e.g. support for [distributed computing](http://www.nest-simulator.org/Parallel_Computing "Parallel Computing"), you can add command line switches to the call to configure. `./configure --help` will show you all available options. For more information on the installation of NEST, please see the file INSTALL that is included in the distribution archive.

### Set up the integrated helpdesk

The command `helpdesk` needs to know which browser to launch in order to display the help pages. The browser is set as an option of `helpdesk`. Please see the file `~/.nestrc` for an example setting `firefox` as browser. Please note that the command `helpdesk` does not work if you have compiled NEST with MPI support, but you have to enter the address of the helpdesk (`file://$PREFIX/share/doc/nest/index.html`) manually into the browser. Please replace `$PREFIX` with the prefix you chose during the configuration of NEST. If you did not explicitly specify one, it is most likely set to `/usr` or
 `/usr/local` depending on what system you are.

### Tell NEST about your MPI setup

If you compiled NEST with support for distributed computing via MPI, you have to tell it how your`mpirun`/`mpiexec` command works by defining the function mpirun in your `~/.nestrc` file. This file already contains an example implementation that should work with [OpenMPI](http://www.openmpi.org/) library.

Mac OS X
--------

### Installation on OSX 10.9 Mavericks

The clang compiler that ships with OSX 10.9 does not support OpenMP threads. You therefore need to use GCC to compile NEST. Below you will find instructions to install all necessary software for building NEST without and with MPI support.

#### NEST without MPI

1.  Install Xcode from the AppStore.
2.  Install the Xcode command line tools by executing the following line in the Terminal and following the instructions in the windows that will pop up

    ``` {.prettyprint}
       xcode-select --install
    ```

3.  Install the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU Science Library, and Python from [MacPorts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macports) (you could use Fink or Homebrew, too, but instructions here are based on MacPorts; if you have installed a complete Python from another source, e.g. Anaconda, you do not need Python from MacPorts):

    ``` {.prettyprint}
      sudo port install gcc48                   # GCC compiler collection
      sudo port select gcc mp-gcc48      # make gcc-48 the default compiler
      sudo port install gsl +gcc48           # install GNU Science Library, use GCC 4.8 compiler
      sudo port install autoconf automake libtool    # build tools

      # now the Python stuff
      sudo port install python27
      sudo port select python python27   # make MacPorts Python 2.7 the default
      sudo port install py27-cython
      sudo port select cython cython27   # make Python 2.7 python the default cython
      sudo port install py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-matplotlib py27-ipython
      sudo port select ipython ipython27   # set default
    ```

4.  Create a directory for building and installing NEST (you should always build NEST outside the source code directory; installing NEST in a "place of its own" makes it easy to remove NEST later).
5.  Extract the NEST tarball as a subdirectory in that directory, create a build-directory next to the source code directory

    ``` {.prettyprint}
      cd ~                  # move to home directory
      mkdir NEST       # directory for all NEST stuff
      cd NEST
      mkdir nest22    # directory for all NEST 2.2 stuff
      cd nest22
      tar zxf  nest-2.2.2.tar.gz
      mkdir bld
      cd bld
    ```

6.  Configure and build NEST inside that directory:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
      ../nest-2.2.2/configure --prefix=<home dir>/NEST/nest22/ins
      make -j4         # -j4 builds in parallel using 4 processes
      make install
      make installcheck
    ```

#### NEST with MPI

To compile NEST with MPI, you need to install OpenMPI first. Unfortunately, recent OpenMPI 1.7 versions do not work with NEST under Mavericks. You therefore need to trick MacPorts into installing OpenMPI 1.6.4. Proceed as follows:

1.  Perform Steps 1-3 as for NEST without MPI above.
2.  Download the MacPorts [Portfile-openmpi-1.6.4.txt](http://www.nest-simulator.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Portfile-openmpi-1.6.4.txt "Portfile-openmpi-1.6.4.txt") and save it under the name `Portfile` in an arbitrary directory
3.  In Terminal, move to the directory containing `Portfile` and run

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    sudo port install +gcc48 +threads configure.compiler=macports-gcc-4.8
    ```

4.  Perform steps 4 and 5 as above.
5.  Configure and build NEST as follows

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    ../nest-2.2.2/configure CXX=openmpicxx --with-mpi --prefix=<home dir>/NEST/nest22/ins
    make -j4
    make install
    make installcheck
    ```

### Installation for Older OSX Versions

Before you can build NEST under Mac OS X, you need to install Xcode from the Apple Developer tools installation DVD that came with your Mac (the packages are called Xcode and Optional on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard). If you are running Mac OS X 10.7 Lion or Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, you need to install Xcode from Mac App Store or download the DMG images from Apple Developer Connection and drag Xcode icon to the Applications folder. Proceed to the [ADC login page](http://connect.apple.com) and enter your ADC ID, then download Xcode 4.3.2 for Lion (or later) and Command Line Tools for Xcode - Late March 2012 (or later).

#### From a tarball

Decide whether you need GSL and SciPy / IPython, if yes, install them from [MacPorts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macports) or [Fink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fink) (command below is for MacPorts and assumes you are using Python 2.7; if using 2.6, replace `py27` with `py26` below):

``` {.prettyprint}
 sudo port install gsl py27-ipython py27-matplotlib py27-scipy
```

You can save yourself some hassle by making this Python installation the default, otherwise you will have to specify the right Python to the configure command:

``` {.prettyprint}
 sudo port select --set python python27
 sudo port select --set ipython ipython27
```

Now follow the generic instructions above to install NEST.

#### From Subversion checkout

Install libtool from sources or a package manager, such as Fink or MacPorts, then run ./bootstrap.sh to bootstrap the build system (create the ./configure script) and proceed as above.

#### Discussion

To install NEST on Mac OS X you basically have three options:

1.  Use only tools and libraries provided by Apple (compiler, system libraries, OpenMPI, Python, NumPy)
2.  Use mostly tools provided by Apple and build the rest from source (Pythons etc.)
3.  Use tools provided by third-party package archives (Fink or MacPorts)

Only options (1) and (3) are recommended for non-expert users. Go for (3) if you are already using either of the package archives mentioned above or intending to use additional Pythons. Go for (1) if you want to get started immediately without any extra software (and compile NEST against system OpenMPI, Python & NumPy, although features requiring GSL / SciPy / matplotlib will not work unless you install them yourself).

The most convenient source for GSL and NumPy / SciPy / matplotlib is MacPorts (Fink probably works as well, but we have not tested this). Another source for a complete Python distribution is the [Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com), but we are not testing against it.

**Note:** as of Mac OS X 10.6 Apple ships glibtool missing libltdl sources, which means that if you want to go for (1) and not use a tarball, but bootstrap the build system from e.g. an SVN checkout, you need to install libtool + libltdl from source (see `extras/install_autotools.sh`).

**Note:** as of Mac OS X 10.7 Apple conveniently no longer provides support for OpenMPI in the default installation. Additionally, clang became the default compiler of choice, but it doesn't support OpenMP yet. Therefore, it makes most sense to install latest GCC, Python, OpenMPI and so on from MacPorts.

### Known problems

####  Using the correct compiler

We strongly recommend that you use the same compiler version to compile NEST that was used to build Python / OpenMPI. Usually, this will be the system compiler (note: by default, MacPorts compiles using the system compiler). Python displays which compiler it was compiled with at startup.

When compiling NEST with a newer GCC than Python was compiled with, most bets are off, since different GCC versions generate different binary code. PyNEST may then crash Python. Either make sure that gcc and g++ are the system compiler, or force compilation with the system compiler, configure like this (append any other configure options):

``` {.prettyprint}
../nest-x.y.z/configure CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++
```

#### MPI issues

Mac OS X 10.5 and later comes with MPI pre-installed and `--with-mpi` should work. If you should get an error message like this

``` {.prettyprint}
libtool: link: /usr/bin/mpicxx -W -Wall -pedantic -Wno-long-long -O0 -g -DNO_UNUSED_SYN -o .libs/nest main.o neststartup.o

ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [nest] Error 1
```

there is most likely a conflict between several MPI installations on your computer, in the example above with OpenMPI from MacPorts. In this case, you need to deactivate/uninstall the conflicting MPI installation. It is unfortunately not trivial to ignore other MPI installations. One brutal work-around is to edit the `nest/Makefile,` in the build directory and add `-L/usr/lib` before all other `-L` options in the line building NEST.

#### Compilation issues

If building NEST with PyNEST and you get an error message like this while compiling PyNEST,

``` {.prettyprint}
g++ -arch ppc -arch i386 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -g
-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup /temp/safari/nest-1.9.8316/pynest/

```

please try making NEST as follows:

``` {.prettyprint}
env MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 make
```

Thanks to Harold Gutch for this hint.

Windows
-------

Windows and Linux differ considerably. This is the reason why it is difficult to compile NEST natively under Windows. However, it is still possible to use NEST under Windows using one of the following methods:

### Using the NEST LiveCD

This is the easiest way to use NEST without having to install anything on your computer. The LiveCD can be used in almost any computer and boots directly into a complete Ubuntu system, which already has NEST, Python, and some analysis tools installed. The CD image is available on the [download page](download.md "Download").

### Virtual Machines

A virtual machine is a software that lets you use Linux in parallel to Windows. We recommend to use VirtualBox, which is free software and can be downloaded from <http://www.virtualbox.org/>. Another popular virtual machine software is <http://www.vmware.com/>. The easiest way to get started is to download the NEST LiveCD from the [download page](download.md "Download") and either just boot the CD image directly or install it into a virtual hard disk.

### Cygwin

Cywin is a software layer which emulates Unix system calls. NEST should compile and install under cygwin with the generic installation instructions. Compilation under Cygwin is very slow, but the execution times are comparable to an equivalent Linux installation.
