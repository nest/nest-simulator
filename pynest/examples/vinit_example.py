# A loop runs over a range of initial membrane voltages.
#
# In the beginning of each iteration, the simulation kernel is put back to
# its initial state using `ResetKernel`.
#
# Next, a neuron is instantiated with ``Create``. The used neuron model
# ``iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr`` is an implementation of a spiking neuron with
# integrate-and-fire dynamics, conductance-based synapses, an additional
# spike-frequency adaptation and relative refractory mechanisms as described
# in [1]_. Incoming spike events induce a postsynaptic change of
# conductance  modeled  by an  exponential  function. ``SetStatus`` allows to
# assign the initial membrane voltage of the current loop run to the neuron.
#
# ``Create`` is used once more to instantiate a ``voltmeter`` as recording device
# which is subsequently connected to the neuron with ``Connect``.
#
# Then, a simulation with a duration of 75 ms is started with ``Simulate``.
#
# When the simulation has finished, the recorded times and membrane voltages
# are read from the voltmeter via ``get``.
#
# Finally, the time course of the membrane voltages is plotted for each of
# the different initial values.
