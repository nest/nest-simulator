/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_random_clipped - test clipped random number distributions

Synopsis: (test_random_clipped.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails

Description: 
/normal_clipped is an example of a clipped random number distribution.
Here we test whether the distribution can be connected to a random
number generator, it can be parameterized, and the range of the
resulting random numbers is correct.
