Name: testsuite::test_iaf_ps_psp_poisson_accuracy - probes interaction of precise poisson generator and neuron model

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_ps_psp_poisson_accuracy) run -> compare with analytical result


Description:

The test probes the interaction of a spike generator implementing a 
poisson process in continuous time with a neuron model capable of 
handling off-grid spike times. The result is verified by comparing the 
superposition of post-synaptic potentials in the neuron model to the 
the corresonding analytical solution. To achieve this, spike 
generation of the neuron mode is prevented by setting the spike 
threshold to a very high value. The test employs the parrot neuron for 
precise spike times to provide the neuron model and the spike detector 
with an identical sequence of spike times. The independence of the 
result from the computations step size is ensured by comparing the 
results for a range of temporal resolutions. Due to this setup the 
test requires that several critical timing relations between network 
nodes of different types operate correctly. If the test fails go back 
to simpler tests verifying individual node types.
