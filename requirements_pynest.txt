# Required Python packages to build and work with PyNEST.
#
# This file specifies the required Python packages to build and work
# with PyNEST. It is meant for those who would like to compile NEST
# or build NEST documentation themselves. If you just want to execute
# NEST, you should install NEST directly as described in
# https://www.nest-simulator.org/installation.
#
# The listed requirements are used to build the conda environment defined
# in the environment yaml file. If you want to build an environment
# yourself, e.g., independent of conda, the requirements from this file
# can be installed by
#
#     pip install -r requirements_pynest.txt
