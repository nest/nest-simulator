/**
 * Create the masks for sources and targets and set them on the
 * Connection Generator.
 *
 * The masks are based on the contiguous ranges present in the given
 * sources and targets. We need to do some index translation here, as
 * the CG expects indices from 0..n for both source and target
 * populations, while the corresponding RangeSets for sources and
 * targets contain NEST global indices (node IDs).
 *
 * The masks for the sources must contain all nodes (local+remote). To
 * achieve this, the skip of the mask is set to 1 and the same source
 * mask is stored n_proc times on each process.
 *
 * The masks for the targets must only contain local nodes. This is
 * achieved by first setting skip to num_processes upon creation of
 * the mask, and second by the fact that for each contiguous range of
 * nodes in a mask, each of them contains the index-translated id of
 * the first local neuron as the first entry. If this renders the
 * range empty (i.e. because the first local id is beyond the last
 * element of the range), the range is not added to the mask.
 *
 * \note Each process computes the full set of source and target
 * masks, i.e. one mask per rank will be created on each rank.
 *
 * \note Setting the masks for all processes on each process might
 * become a memory bottleneck when going to very large numbers of
 * processes. Especially so for the source masks, which are all the
 * same. This could be solved by making the ConnectionGenerator
 * interface MPI aware and communicating the masks during connection
 * setup.
