/** @BeginDocumentation
    Name: testsuite::test_mat2_psc_exp - sli script for overall test of mat2_psc_exp neuron model

    Synopsis: (test_mat2_psc_exp) run -> compares response to current step with reference data 

    Description:
    test_mat2_psc_exp.sli is an overall test of the mat2_neuron model connected
    to some useful devices.

    A DC current is injected into the neuron using a current generator
    device. The membrane potential, the threshold potential as well as the
    spiking activity are recorded by corresponding devices.

    It can be observed how the current charges the membrane, a spike
    is emitted, the threshold potential is updated and evaluated whereas
    the membrane potential is not reset and further evaluated, too.
    Additionally the neuron becomes refractory after emitting a spike.

    The timing of the various events on the simulation grid is of
    particular interest and crucial for the consistency of the
    simulation scheme.

    Although 0.1 cannot be represented in the IEEE double data type, it
    is safe to simulate with a resolution (computation step size) of 0.1
    ms because by default nest is built with a timebase enabling exact
    representation of 0.1 ms.

    The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of
    the script.

    Other test programs discuss the various aspects of this script in detail,
    see the SeeAlso key below.
