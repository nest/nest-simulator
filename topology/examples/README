These scripts were originally created for the 

NEST Topology BCCN Tutorial @ CNS*09

Updated 
- August 2009 to new module organization in PyNEST per NEST 1.9.r8375 or later.
- May 2010 to new FindConnections scheme in PyNEST per NEST 1.9.r8411 or later.
- October 2010 to new Topology Python interface per NEST 1.9.r8990 or later. 
- December 2012 to Topology3 Interface
- January 2013 to new GetConnections scheme per NEST 2.2 or later.

All scripts should be run using ipython -pylab.

Otherwise, you may need to add pylab.show() commands to draw the figures.

You can find a somewhat outdated version of the tutorial on the NEST Website
