%  Event Timing Test Program:     SLI Input of Time Values
%  --------------------------
%
%  This program is part of a series of test programs verifying the 
%  consistency of event timing in the simulation kernel.
%  
%  Here we check whether the SLI code specification of time 
%  values in units of ms works.
%
%  The expected output is documented at the end of the script.

% Expected output of this program:

% The expected output probably is that the value of /start remains
% equal to the specified value at least to the accuracy of the time
% base of the simulation kernel 
% (not the current computation step size).
