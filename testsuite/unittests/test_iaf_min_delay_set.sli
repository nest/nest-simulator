Name: testsuite::test_iaf_min_delay_set - sli script for testing explicit specification of min_delay

Synopsis: (test_iaf_min_delay_set) run -> compares results for different min_delays


Description:

  The simulation is run with a range of different min_delays. All
  should give identical results. This is achieved by sampling the
  membrane potential at a fixed interval.

  The min_delay is specified by explicitly setting the corresponding
  default property of a synapse type. The companion test
  test_iaf_min_delay_create sets the value by creating a corresponding
  connection.

  Other test scripts discuss the various aspects of this script in detail,
  see the SeeAlso key below. If this test fails go back to the simpler ones.
