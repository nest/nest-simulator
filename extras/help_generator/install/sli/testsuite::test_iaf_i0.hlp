Name: testsuite::test_iaf_i0 - sli script for test of iaf_neuron internal DC current

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_i0) run -> compares response to internal dc with reference data


Description:

test_iaf_i0.sli is a test of a specific feature of the iaf_neuron 
model. It is tested whether an internal DC current that is present 
from the time of neuron initialization, correctly affects the membrane 
potential. 
This is probably the simplest setup in which we can study how the 
dynamics develops from an initial condition. 
The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
the script. 
When the DC current is supplied by a device external to the neuron 
the situation is more complex because additional delays are introduced.
