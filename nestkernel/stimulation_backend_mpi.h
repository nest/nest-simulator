Stimulation backend `mpi` - Receive stimulation parameters via MPI
##################################################################

.. admonition:: Availability

   This stimulation backend is only available if NEST was compiled with
   :ref:`support for MPI <compile-with-mpi>`.

The `mpi` stimulation backend collects data from MPI channels and
updates stimulation devices just before each run. This is useful for
co-simulation or for receiving stimuli from external software.

The name of the MPI port to receive data on is read from a file for
each device configured to use this backend.  The file needs to be
named according to the following pattern:

::

   {data_path}/{data_prefix}{label}/{node_id}.txt

The ``data_path`` and ``data_prefix`` are global kernel properties,
while `label` is a property of the device in question and `node_id`
its node ID. This path can only be set outside of a ``Run`` context
(i.e.  after ``Prepare()`` has been called, but ``Cleanup()`` has
not).

Communication Protocol
++++++++++++++++++++++

The following protocol is used to exchange information between both
MPI processes. The protocol is described using the following format
for the MPI messages: (value, number, type, source/destination, tag)

1) ``Prepare``   : Connection of MPI port include in one file (see below)
2) ``Run`` begin : Send start run (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 0)
3) ``Run`` begin : Send the id of the device to update (node_id, 1, INT, 0, 0)
4) ``Run`` begin : Receive shape of the data (shape, 1, INT, 0, 0)
5) ``Run`` begin : Receive the data for updating the device (data, shape, DOUBLE, 0, 0)
6) ``Run`` end   : Send at each ending of the run (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 1)
7) ``Cleanup``   : Send at this en of the simulation (true, 1, CXX_BOOL, 0, 2)

Data format
+++++++++++

The format of the data depends on the exact type of stimulation
device.
