Example of multimeter recording to file
---------------------------------------

This file demonstrates recording from an ``iaf_cond_alpha`` neuron using a
multimeter and writing data to file.

###############################################################################
# First, we import the necessary modules to simulate and plot this example.
# The simulation kernel is put back to its initial state using ``ResetKernel``.

import nest
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

nest.ResetKernel()

###############################################################################
# Global properties of the simulation kernel can be set via attributes
# of the nest module. The following properties are related to writing to file:
#
# * ``overwrite_files`` can be set True to permit overwriting of existing files.
# * ``data_path`` is the path to which all data is written. It is given relative
#   to  the current working directory.
# * ``data_prefix`` allows to specify a common prefix for all data files.

nest.overwrite_files = True
nest.data_path = ""
nest.data_prefix = ""

###############################################################################
# For illustration, the recordables of the ``iaf_cond_alpha`` neuron model are
# displayed. This model is an implementation of a spiking neuron using
# integrate-and-fire dynamics with conductance-based synapses. Incoming spike
# events induce a postsynaptic change of conductance modeled by an alpha
# function.

print("iaf_cond_alpha recordables: {0}".format(
      nest.GetDefaults("iaf_cond_alpha")["recordables"]))

###############################################################################
# A neuron, a multimeter as recording device, and two spike generators for
# excitatory and inhibitory stimulation are instantiated. The command ``Create``
# expects a model type and, optionally, the desired number of nodes and a
# dictionary of parameters to overwrite the default values of the model.
#
#  * For the neuron, the rise time of the excitatory synaptic alpha function
#    (`tau_syn_ex`, in ms) and the reset potential of the membrane
#    (`V_reset`, in mV) are specified.
#  * For the ``multimeter``, the time interval for recording (`interval`, in
#    ms) and the measures to record (membrane potential `V_m` in mV and
#    excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances `g_ex` and`g_in` in nS)
#    are set.
#
#  In addition, more parameters can be modified for writing to file:
#
#  - `record_to` indicates where to put recorded data. All possible values are
#    available by inspecting the keys of the dictionary obtained from the
#    kernel attribute ``recording_backends``.
#  - `label` specifies an arbitrary label for the device. If writing to files,
#    it used in the file name instead of the model name.
#
#  * For the spike generators, the spike times in ms (`spike_times`) are given
#    explicitly.

n = nest.Create("iaf_cond_alpha",
                params={"tau_syn_ex": 1.0, "V_reset": -70.0})

s_in = nest.Create("spike_generator",
                   params={"spike_times": numpy.array([15.0, 25.0, 55.0])})

###############################################################################
# Next, we connect the spike generators to the neuron with ``Connect``. Synapse
# specifications can be provided in a dictionary. In this example of a
# conductance-based neuron, the synaptic weight ``weight`` is given in nS.
# Note that the values are  positive for excitatory stimulation and negative
# for inhibitor connections.

# A network simulation with a duration of 100 ms is started with ``Simulate``.

# After the simulation, the recordings are obtained from the file the
# multimeter wrote to, accessed with the `filenames` property of the
# multimeter. After three header rows, the data is formatted in columns. The
# first column is the ID of the sender node. The second column is the time
# of the recording, in ms. Subsequent rows are values of properties specified
# in the `record_from` property of the multimeter.

# conductance are displayed.
