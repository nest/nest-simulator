''' Network of linear rate neurons
----------------------------------------

This script simulates an excitatory and an inhibitory population
of lin_rate_ipn neurons with delayed excitatory and instantaneous
inhibitory connections. The rate of all neurons is recorded using
a multimeter. The resulting rate for one excitatory and one
inhibitory neuron is plotted.
