 growth_factor_buffer_target_data      double      - If MPI buffers for communication of connections resize on the fly,
                                                     grow them by this factor each round, defaults to 1.5.

                                                     buffer size. spike_buffer_shrink_limit == 0 means that buffers
                                                     never shrink. See `spike_buffer_shrink_spare` for how the new

                                                     (1 + spike_buffer_shrink_spare) * required_buffer_size`.
                                                     See `spike_buffer_shrink_limit` for when buffers shrink.
                                                     Defaults to 0.1.
 spike_buffer_resize_log               dict        - Information on spike buffer resizing as dictionary. It contains the
                                                     times of the resizings (simulation clock in steps, always multiple
                                                     of min_delay), global_max_spikes_sent, that is, the observed spike
                                                     number that triggered the resize, and the new_buffer_size. Sizes
                                                     are for the buffer section sent from one rank to another rank (read only).
 keep_source_table                     booltype    - Whether to keep source table after connection setup is complete,
                                                     defaults to true.
 local_spike_counter                   integertype - Number of spikes fired by neurons on a given MPI rank during the
                                                     most recent call to Simulate(). Only spikes from “normal” neurons
                                                     are counted, not spikes generated by devices such as
                                                     poisson_generator (read only).
 max_num_syn_models                    integertype - Maximal number of synapse models supported (read only).
 network_size                          integertype - The number of nodes in the network (read only).
 node_models                           arraytype   - The list of available node models (neurons and devices; read only).
 num_connections                       integertype - The number of connections in the network (read only; local only).
 stimulation_backends                  arraytype   - List of available backends for stimulation devices (read-only).
 structural_plasticity_synapses        dicttype    - Defines all synapses which are plastic for the structural
                                                     plasticity algorithm. Each entry in the dictionary is composed of
                                                     a synapse model, the presynaptic element and the postsynaptic
                                                     element.
 structural_plasticity_update_interval integertype - Defines the time interval in ms at which the structural plasticity
                                                     manager will make changes in the structure of the network (creation
                                                     and deletion of plastic synapses), defaults to 10000.
