# FindGSL
# --------
#
# Find the native GSL includes and libraries.
#
# The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++
# programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public
# License.
#
# Imported Targets
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If GSL is found, this module defines the following :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`
# targets::
#
#  GSL::gsl      - The main GSL library.
#  GSL::gslcblas - The CBLAS support library used by GSL.
#
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module will set the following variables in your project::
#
#  GSL_FOUND          - True if GSL found on the local system
#  GSL_INCLUDE_DIRS   - Location of GSL header files.
#  GSL_LIBRARIES      - The GSL libraries.
#  GSL_VERSION        - The version of the discovered GSL install.
#
# Hints
# ^^^^^
#
# Set ``GSL_ROOT_DIR`` to a directory that contains a GSL installation.
#
# This script expects to find libraries at ``$GSL_ROOT_DIR/lib`` and the GSL
# headers at ``$GSL_ROOT_DIR/include/gsl``.  The library directory may
# optionally provide Release and Debug folders.  For Unix-like systems, this
# script will use ``$GSL_ROOT_DIR/bin/gsl-config`` (if found) to aid in the
# discovery GSL.
#
# Cache Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module may set the following variables depending on platform and type
# of GSL installation discovered.  These variables may optionally be set to
# help this module find the correct files::
#
#  GSL_CLBAS_LIBRARY       - Location of the GSL CBLAS library.
#  GSL_CBLAS_LIBRARY_DEBUG - Location of the debug GSL CBLAS library (if any).
#  GSL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE   - Location of the ``gsl-config`` script (if any).
#  GSL_LIBRARY             - Location of the GSL library.
#  GSL_LIBRARY_DEBUG       - Location of the debug GSL library (if any).
