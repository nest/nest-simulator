Name: testsuite::test_gif_cond_exp_multisynapse - sli script for test of gif_cond_exp_multisynapse with external DC current and spike generators

Synopsis: (test_gif_cond_exp_multisynapse) run


Description:

 This testscript checks the correctness of gif_cond_exp_multisynapse neuron model. It injects external DC current and also three spikes to the neuron model and measures neuron's spike times. The spike times should match the expected values.
