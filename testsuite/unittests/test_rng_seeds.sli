/** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_rng_seeds - test if setting and getting of the rng seeds works

Synopsis: (test_rng_seeds) run -> dies if assertion fails

Description:
This script checks for different numbers of threads if the seeds are
consistently set for all threads. This script can be run using a
single process. However, to test all aspects of rng seeding, it should
be run via mpirun and different numbers of processes.
