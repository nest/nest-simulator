Name: MergeLists - merges sorted lists

Synopsis:

array array	 MergeLists  -> array 
array array proc MergeLists  -> array


Examples:

[1 3 5] [2 7] MergeLists -> [1 2 3 5 7] 
[[-9 1] [1 3] [4 5]]  [[3 2] [0 7]] {exch 1 get exch 1 get lt} MergeLists -> 
[[-9 1] [3 2] [1 3] [4 5] [0 7]]


Description:

MergeLists is unlike Union which removes repeated elements and does 
not require the arguments to be sorted. However, the result of 
Union is also sorted. MergeLists does not appear in Mathematica V4.0, 
Union does.
