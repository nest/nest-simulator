    class DoubleDatum
*/

// Includes from sli:
#include "datum.h"
#include "interpret.h"
#include "numericdatum.h"


/* These are declarations to specialize the static memory pool BEFORE
   we instantiate the AggregateDatum. Note, that this is only a declaration,
   because we do not provide an initializer (see ISO14882 Sec.  14.7.3.15.)
   The definition is given in the *.CC file with the appropriate
   initializer.

   Note that SUN's Forte 6.2 does not handle this correctly, so we have
   to use a compiler-switch. 1.2002 Gewaltig

   The Alpha cxx V6.3-002 says that storage class extern is not allowed here,
   so I removed it. 15.2.2002 Diesmann
