# Neural simulations

## Overview

A simulation of a network is like an experiment with the difference that it
takes place inside the computer's memory rather than in the physical world.

Like in a real experiment, you need a system which you want to investigate.
Moreover, you need a clear idea of *what* you want to learn from the experiment.
In the context of a network simulation this means that you have to know
*which input* you want to give to your network and *which output* you expect.

The next section will illustrate the main concepts of NEST simulations, using a
simple simulation. The following sections will then give a step-by-step
introduction to the main concepts of NEST simulations. Finally, we will discuss
a complex example.

## A simple simulation

The simplest simulation in NEST is that of a network which contains just one
neuron:

    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha Create /neuron Set

We are going to simulate a standard integrate and fire model with resting
potential at -70 mV and spike threshold at -55 mV. In this line, we use the
model `iaf_psc_alpha` to create a neuron. The command `Create` returns a handle to
the created neuron, which we store in the variable `neuron`.

Next, we would like to add a stimulation and a recording device to the neuron,
so that we will see something during the simulation.

In our little example, we want to inject a current into the neuron and record
its membrane potential. Thus, we need to create the corresponding devices and
connect them to the neuron:

    SLI ] /voltmeter Create  /vm Set

This command creates a voltmeter node. The handle to the new voltmeter is stored
in the variable `vm`.

By default, the voltmeter will only record membrane potential values, so we
configure it to show us the time stamp of each value as well. We also set it to
print the time and potential to the screen and we set the recording interval to
0.1 ms. The default is 1.0 ms.

    SLI ] vm << /withtime true /to_screen true /interval 0.1 >> SetStatus

The double angled brackets ` << ` and ` >> `delimit a dictionary definition
which consists of successive `/key value ` pairs.

After setting the parameters of the voltmeter, we connect it to the neuron,
using the handles we have created above:

    SLI ] vm neuron Connect

Now we create a DC generator which will supply a constant current to our neuron:

    SLI ] /dc_generator Create /stim Set

Next, we want to set the amplitude of the DC generator such that it delivers
enough current to elicit a spike in the neuron:

    SLI ] stim << /amplitude 600.0 >> SetStatus

Here, we only adjust the strength of the input, we set its new value to `600.0`,
which is the amplitude in pA.

We have to connect the DC generator to the neuron:

    SLI ] stim neuron Connect

We can now run the simulation and expect to see some results:

    SLI ] 15.0 Simulate

The command `Simulate` runs the simulation for the specified number of
milliseconds. Below, you see a transcript of the simulation:

        Simulation finished.
    Nov 10 08:57:51 Scheduler::finalize_nodes() [Info]:
         using OpenMP.

After some initial messages from the simulation scheduler, we see the output
from the voltmeter. The number in the left column represents the global ID (GID)
of the model neuron and the center column the network time in milliseconds. The
right column contains the values of the membrane potential at that time. The
potential is given in mV.

By default, NEST uses a simulation stepsize of 0.1 ms. With a simulation time
of 15.0 ms, we have 150 simulation steps.

The neuron that we have simulated was a standard *integrate-and-fire* neuron
\[Tuckwell91\] with a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold at -55.0 mV.
We see the first effect of the DC input current at 1.2 ms. This time delay is
due to several reasons: The `dc_generator` emits the first current output at the
end of the first time step, i.e., at 0.1 ms. Since the connection between
generator and neuron was created with the default delay of 1 ms, the current
signal arrives at the neuron at 1.1 ms and thus affects the membrane potential
for the first time during the time step from 1.1 ms to 1.2 ms.

During the time step from 10.9 ms to 11.0 ms, the membrane potential crosses the
threshold value -55.0 mV. Thus, the neuron emits an output spike at 11.0 ms and
the membrane potential is then reset to -70.0 mV and clamped to the resting
value for 2 ms, the refractory period of the neuron. After the refractory
period, the membrane continues to depolarize due to the continuing input
current.

## Nodes and Models

In NEST, the neural system is a collection of nodes and their interactions.
Nodes correspond to things like neurons, synapses, and devices, and are
implemented in C++. The network and its configuration are defined at the level
of the simulation language interpreter.

Nodes are created from a set of prescribed models which are stored in the
dictionary `modeldict`. The most important neuron models are:

Model name
Description
`iaf_psc_alpha`
Simple integrate-and-fire neuron with alpha-function PSCs.
`iaf_psc_delta`
Integrate-and-fire neuron with delta-function PSCs.
`iaf_cond_alpha`
Conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron with alpha-function synapses.
`iaf_cond_exp`
Conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron with exp-function synapses.
`hh_psc_alpha`
`hh_cond_exp_traub`
In order to make the models visible to the interpreter, the model dictionary
has to be opened.

### Creating nodes

Before continuing with the example, we reset NEST, to clear all nodes that we
have created before.

    SLI ] ResetKernel
    Sep 21 10:13:39 Network::clear_models [Info]:
     Models will be cleared and parameters reset.

Nodes are created from a model, using the command `Create`.

    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha Create ==
    1

In the fist line, we create one integrate and fire neuron from the model
`iaf_psc_alpha`.

The return value of `Create` is an integer that identifies the last node that
was created in the network (note that this can be different from 1 if you have
not called `ResetKernel before)`. This integer is called the node's *global id*
(the network as a whole owns the global id `0`, therefore the ids of
user-created nodes start with `1`). Often, it is neccessary to have a large
number of nodes of the same type. The command Create can also be used for this
purpose. The following line of code create 10 integrate and fire neurons:

    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha 10 Create ==
    11

## Status information

Nodes have a state which can be extracted and modified. In the follwing example,
we display the status information of one the neurons in the layer we have
created above:

    SLI ] 1 ShowStatus
    --------------------------------------------------                                                                                
    Name                     Type                Value                                                                                
    --------------------------------------------------                                                                                
    archiver_length          integertype         0

    E_L                      doubletype          -70

    t_spike                  doubletype          -1
    vp                       integertype         0

    V_reset                  doubletype          -70
    V_th                     doubletype          -55
    --------------------------------------------------
    Total number of entries: 24

Using the command `SetStatus`, it is possible to change the entries of this so
called *status dictionary*. The following lines of code change the threshold
value `V_th` to -60 mV:

    SLI ] 1 << /V_th -60.0 >> SetStatus
    SLI ] 1 GetStatus /V_th get =
    -60

Please note, that `SetStatus` checks if a property really exists in a node and
will issue an error if it doesn't. This behavior can be changed by the following
command:

    0 << /dict_miss_is_error false >> SetStatus

Then, NEST is very tolerant with respect to the property that you are trying to
change: If it does not know the property, or if the property cannot be changed,
there will be no error, but only a warning. In any case, `SetStatus` does
complain if the new value does not match in the expected type:

    SLI ] 1 << /V_th (60) >> SetStatus


    Dec 01 15:33:54 SetStatus_ad [Error]: TypeMismatch
        Expected datatype: doubletype
        Provided datatype: stringtype

In order to find out, which properties of a given model can be changed an which
not, you have to refer to the model's documentation.

## Connections

Connections between nodes define possible channels for interactions between
them. A connection between two nodes is established, using the command
`Connect`.

Each connection has two basic parameters, *weight* and *delay*. The weight
determines the strength of the connection, the delay determines how long an
event needs to travel from the sending to the receiving node. The delay must be
a positive number greater or equal to the simulation stepsize and is given in
ms.

### Example 1

    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha Create /n1 Set
    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha Create /n2 Set
    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha Create /n3 Set
    SLI ]
    SLI ] n1 n2 Connect
    SLI ] n1 n3 Connect

To inspect the parameters of a connection, one first needs to obtain a handle
to the connection. This is done using the command `GetConnections`. It takes a
dictionary that at least contains the id of the source node and will return a
list of handles for all outgoing connections. The search can be restricted by
using the optional parameters *target* and *synapse\_type*.

### Example 2

    SLI ] << /source n1 >> GetConnections /c1 Set
    SLI ] c1 length ==
    2
    SLI ] << /source n1 /target n2 >> GetConnections /c2 Set
    SLI ] c2 length ==
    1

To actually see the parameters of the connection, `GetStatus` is used, just like
it is for nodes.

### Example 3

    SLI ] c1 0 get GetStatus info
    --------------------------------------------------
    Name                     Type                Value
    --------------------------------------------------
    delay                    doubletype          1
    receptor                 integertype         0
    sizeof                   integertype         32
    source                   integertype         1
    synapse_model            literaltype         static_synapse
    target                   integertype         2
    weight                   doubletype          1
    --------------------------------------------------
    Total number of entries: 7

To change the paramters of a connection, `SetStatus` is used, just like it is
for nodes.

### Example 4

    SLI ] c1 0 get << /weight 2.0 >> SetStatus
    SLI ] c1 0 get GetStatus /weight get ==
    2.000000e+00

## Devices

Devices are network nodes which provide input to the network or record its
output. They encapsulate the stimulation and measurement process. If you want
to extract certain information from a simulation, you need a device which is
able to deliver this information. Likewise, if you want to send specific input
to the network, you need a device which delivers this input.

Devices have a built-in timer which controls the period they are active. Outside
this interval, a device will remain siltent. The timer can be configured using
the command `SetStatus`.

By definition a device is active in the interval \\((t\_1,t\_2)\\)
, if we can observe events \\(E\\)
with time stamps \\(t\_E\\)
which obey \\(t\_1 <= t\_E < t\_2\\)
for all \\(E\\)
.
In other words, the interval during which the device is active corresponds to
the range of time-stamps of the device's events.

Note that it is not possible to generate/observe an event with time stamp 0.

### Device parameters

The following entries of the status dictionary are the same for all stimulation
and recording devices:

Property
Type
Description
`/start`
double
First time of activity, relative to the value of `origin` in ms.
`/stop`
double
First time of inactivity, relative to the value of `origin` in ms.
`/origin`
double
Origin of the device clock, relative to the network time in ms.
In general, the following must hold:

1.  *stop* \>= *start*
2.  If *stop =* start*, the device is inactive.*

### Stimulating Devices

A range of devices is available for the stimulation of neurons. The most
important ones are listed in the following table. For details, refer to the
documentation of the respective decive.

Model name
Description
`spike_generator`
Device to generate spikes at specific times.
`poisson_generator`
Device to generate poisson shotnoise.
`dc_generator`
Device to generate a constant current.
`ac_generator`
Device to generate an alternating (sine) current.
`step_current_generator`
Device to generate a step current with different amplitudes at different times.

#### Example 5

    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha Create /n Set
    SLI ] /poisson_generator Create /pg Set
    SLI ] pg << /rate 220.0 Hz >> SetStatus
    SLI ] pg n Connect

### Recording devices

All devices which are used to observe the state of other network nodes are
called recording devices. Examples are `voltmeter` and `spike_detector`.

Recording devices have properties which control the amount, the format, and the
destination of their output. All recorders can either dump the recorded data to
a file (property `to_file`), print it to the screen (property `to_screen`) or
hold the data in memory (property `to_memory`). Data stored in memory can be
retrieved after the simulation using `GetStatus`.

Device models are also stored in the dictionary `modeldict`. The most important
devices are:

Model name
Description
`voltmeter`
Device to observe membrane potentials.
`multimeter`
Device to observe arbitrary analog quantities.
`spike_detector`
Device to observe spike times.
Please note that the connection direction for analog recorders (all except
`spike_detector` in above list) is inverted with respect to other recorders.

#### Example 6

    SLI ] /iaf_psc_alpha Create /n Set
    SLI ] /voltmeter Create /vm Set
    SLI ] /spike_detector Create /sd Set
    SLI ] vm n Connect
    SLI ] n sd Connect

## Simulation

NEST simulations are time driven. The simulation time proceeds in discrete steps
of size `dt`, set using the property `resolution` of the root node. In each time
slice, all nodes in the system are updated and pending events are delivered.

The simulation is run by calling the command `t Simulate`, where `t` is the
simulation time in milliseconds
