NEST is a simulator for **spiking neural network models**, ideal for networks of any size, for example:

1.  Models of information processing e.g. in the visual or auditory cortex of
    mammals,

2.  Models of network activity dynamics, e.g. laminar cortical networks or
    balanced random networks,

3.  Models of learning and plasticity.

How the documentation is organized
##################################

* :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` show you step by step instructions using NEST. If you haven't used NEST before, the PyNEST tutorial is a good place to start.

* :doc:`Example Networks <examples/index>`  demonstrate the use of dozens of the neural network models implemented in NEST.

* :doc:`Topical Guides <guides/index>` provide deeper insight into several topics and concepts from :doc:`Parallel Computing <guides/parallel_computing>` to handling :doc:`Gap Junction Simulations <guides/simulations_with_gap_junctions>` and :doc:`setting up a topological network <topology/index>`.

* :doc:`Reference Material <ref_material/index>` provides a quick look up of definitions, functions and terms.
