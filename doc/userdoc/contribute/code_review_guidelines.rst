Code review guidelines
======================

Using our purely :ref:`pull-request-based workflow <git_workflow>`,
code can be developed very flexibly by internal and external
contributors. At the same time this workflow allows us to enforce
stricter rules on code that ends up in the public repository.

Following are rough guidelines for the code reviewers. These are not
meant to prevent progress, but to keep up the code quality as the
number of developers is growing. All of this is not set in stone and
can be discussed on the :ref:`NEST mailing lists <community>`.

* In general, the rule is that each pull request needs an OK from the CI
  platform and at least two reviewers to be merged.
* For changes labeled “not code” or “minor” (e.g., changes in documentation,
  fixes for typos, etc.), the release manager can waive the need for code
  review and just accept the OK from the CI system in order to merge the request.
* Each pull request needs to be documented by an issue in the `issue
  tracker <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues>`_ explaining the reason
  for the changes and the solution. The issue is also the place for discussions
  about the code.
* New features like SLI or PyNEST functions, neuron or synapse models need to
  be accompanied by one or more tests written either in SLI or Python. New
  features for the NEST kernel need a test written in SLI.
* Each change to the code has to be reflected also in the corresponding
  examples and documentation.
* All source code has to be adhering to the Coding Guidelines for
  :ref:`C++ <code_style_cpp>` in order to
  pass the :ref:`continuous integration system <cont_integration>`.
* All commits should be coherent and contain only changes that belong together.
* Please check the **typeset documentation** as part of the review process. To
  learn how to test the documentation locally offline, please check out our
  :ref:`User documentation workflow <userdoc_workflow>`.
