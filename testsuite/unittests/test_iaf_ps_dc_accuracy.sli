 /** @BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_iaf_ps_dc_accuracy - test of accuracy of neuron models subject to DC current

Synopsis: (test_iaf_ps_dc_accuracy) run -> comparison with analytical solution

Description:

 A DC current is injected for a finite duration. The membrane potential at
 the end of the simulated interval is compared to the theoretical value for
 different computation step sizes.

 Computation step sizes are specified as base 2 values.

 Two different intervals are tested. At the end of the first interval the membrane
 potential still steeply increases. At the end of the second, the membrane 
 potential has within double precision already reached the limit for large t.

 The high accuracy of the neuron models is achieved by the use of Exact Integration [1]
 and an appropriate arrangement of the terms [2]. For small computation step sizes the 
 accuracy at large simulation time decreases because of the accumulation of errors.

 The expected output is documented at the end of the script.
 Individual simulation results can be inspected by uncommented the call 
 to function print_details.

Remarks:

 The script checks whether the kernel can be appropriately configured.
 The script can be used to check whether the accuracy has survived optimization
 by the C++ compiler.

 In case the accuracy is higher than specified by IEEE arithmetics this might
 be due to the use of processor registers. The compiler option   
 -ffloat-store of the gcc compiler ensures that doubles are not stored in 
 registers.

% Theory for the fixed point of the iteration (case T=500ms)
% ----------------------------------------------------------
%
% The difference between the theoretical value reached by the membrane potential
% at large t and the fixed point of the iteration is neither determined by
% the accuracy exponentials can be computed nor by the accumulation of round-off
% errors. The only relevant term is the smallest increment to the membrane potential
% that can be represented in the vicinity the fixed point. The increment in
% the iteration is the product of the distance from the limiting value and a term
% decreasing with decreasing h. Thus, for smaller h a larger error is 
% to be tolerated.
%  
%
% The iteration for the membrane potential is of the form
%
%      y_{i+1}  =  p * (y_i - y^*) + y_i
%
% where y^* is the theoretical fixed point
%
%           y^* = Tau/C * I0
%
% and p element in (-1,0] an h-dependent coefficient (i.e. p=expm1(-h/Tau) ).
% The iteration
%
%    for(int j=0; j<(500/ldexp(1,i)); j++)
%    {
%     y = p * (y - ystar) + y;
%    }
%
% exactly reproduces the values of the fourth column in the second table below.
%
% The fixed point y of the iteration is reached when p*(y-y^*) is so small
% that compared to y in double representation the sum of the two is 
% indistinguishable from y. 
% Let us assume that y is close to the theoretical value. The smallest 
% representable difference is then given by
%
%   s = 2^floor( log2(y^*) ) * eps
%
% where eps is the machine epsilon. In C++ this reads
%
%  x=std::frexp(ystar,&p); s=std::ldexp(1,p -1)*std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon();
%
% The difference that can just not be represented is s/2.
% The condition for the fixed point of the iteration therefore is
%
%      s/2 = p * (y - y^*)
%
% solving for the difference dy between the fixed point and its 
% theoretical value we obtain
%
%      dy = s/2/p 
% or
%       y = y^* + s/2/p 
%
% The fixed points predicted by these considerations are:
%
%  h in ms              y^* + s/2/p
