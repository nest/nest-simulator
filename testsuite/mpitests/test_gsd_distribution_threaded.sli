 /* BeginDocumentation
Name: testsuite::test_gsd_distribution_threaded- Test global spike detector with hybrid MPI and thread parallelism

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_gsd_distribution_threaded.sli -> -

Description:
Tests if global spike detectors are equally distributed among virtual
recording processes. The script creates 4 Spike detectors on 1x2 and
2x2 recording processes and checks if they are equally distributed.
