Name: testsuite::test_getrng_Vmset - test whether Vm can consistently be set to random value

Synopsis:

nest_indirect test_getrng_Vmset ->	-


Description:

The script demonstrates two methods of supplying nodes with random 
numbers independent of the number of jobs used to carry out the 
simulation. 
Both methods loop over all nodes in the network and would therefore 
constitute a serial component of run time.  The test was developed in 
the context of ticket $336.
