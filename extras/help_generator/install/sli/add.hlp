Description:

add can be used to add numbers and arrays. 
If applied to numbers, add returns the sum of the numbers. If one 
of the arguments is a double, the result is also a double. 
Applied to arrays, add perfoms a per-component addition of the two 
arrays. The components must be numbers, however, integer and double 
values may be mixed. 
Note that the two arrays must be of the same size.
