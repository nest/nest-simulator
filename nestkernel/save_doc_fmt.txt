                                                     (read only).
 growth_factor_buffer_target_data      double      - If MPI buffers for communication of connections resize on the fly,
                                                     grow them by this factor each round, defaults to 1.5.
 spike_buffer_grow_extra               double      - When spike exchange buffer needs to be expanded, resize to 
                                                     (1 + spike_buffer_grow_extra) * required_buffer_size 
 spike_buffer_shrink_limit             double      - If largest number of spikes sent from any rank to any rank is
                                                     less than spike_buffer_shrink_limit * buffer_size, then reduce
                                                     buffer size. spike_buffer_shrink_limit == 0 means that buffers
                                                     never shrink. See `spike_buffer_shrink_factor` for how much buffer
                                                     shrinks.
 spike_buffer_shrink_spare             double      - When buffer needs to shrink, set new size to
                                                     (1 + spike_buffer_shrink_spare) * required_buffer_size`.
                                                     See `spike_buffer_shrink_limit` for when buffers shrink.
 spike_buffer_resize_log               dict        - Information on spike buffer resizing as dictionary. It contains the
                                                     times of the resizings (simulation clock in steps, always multiple
                                                     of min_delay), global_max_spikes_sent, i.e., the observed spike
                                                     number that triggered the resize, and the new_buffer_size. Sizes
                                                     are for the section addressing one rank (read only).
 keep_source_table                     booltype    - Whether to keep source table after connection setup is complete,
                                                     defaults to true.
 local_spike_counter                   integertype - Number of spikes fired by neurons on a given MPI rank during the
                                                     most recent call to Simulate(). Only spikes from “normal” neurons
                                                     are counted, not spikes generated by devices such as
                                                     poisson_generator (read only).
 max_num_syn_models                    integertype - Maximal number of synapse models supported (read only).
 network_size                          integertype - The number of nodes in the network (read only).
 node_models                           arraytype   - The list of available node models (neurons and devices; read only).
 num_connections                       integertype - The number of connections in the network (read only; local only).
 stimulation_backends                  arraytype   - List of available backends for stimulation devices (read-only).
 structural_plasticity_synapses        dicttype    - Defines all synapses which are plastic for the structural
                                                     plasticity algorithm. Each entry in the dictionary is composed of
                                                     a synapse model, the presynaptic element and the postsynaptic
                                                     element.
 structural_plasticity_update_interval integertype - Defines the time interval in ms at which the structural plasticity
                                                     manager will make changes in the structure of the network (creation
                                                     and deletion of plastic synapses), defaults to 10000.
 synapse_models                        arraytype   - The list of the available synapse models (read only).
