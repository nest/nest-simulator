Name: testsuite::test_badhandler - test if SLI returns exit code 126 when an error is handled by a bad user error handler.

Synopsis:

(test_badhandler) run ->


Description:

This script establishes a user error handler and then provokes an 
error. The error handler itself contains an error. This error should 
be reported by the interpreter and cause NEST to quit with exit code 126.


Remarks:

Yes, this script is really meant to fail!
