# Writing neuron models

We are currently in the process of transitioning from the old way of
writing models for NEST (i.e manually by implementing a C++ class) to
our new modeling language NESTML, which allows to write neuron models
using domain concepts from computational neuroscience as first level
objects and generate the source code automatically.

If you intend to write your own neuron model, please have a look
at [the NESTML GitHub page](https://github.com/nest/nestml). In case
of questions, feel free to subscribe to
the [NEST mailing list](http://www.nest-simulator.org/community/). If
you find any problems with NESTML, we kindly ask you to open an issue
on the [NESTML issue tracker](https://github.com/nest/nestml) on
GitHub.
