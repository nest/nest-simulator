  /** @BeginDocumentation

    Name: testsuite::test_rate_connections - This test ensures that rate connections
    (rate_connection_instantaneous, rate_connection_delayed, diffusion_connection) work properly.

    Synopsis: (test_rate_connections) run -> NEST exits if test fails

    Description:
    The test ensures that legal rate connections can be created and that an exception 
    is thrown if one tries to create illegal rate connections. 
    Furthermore it is checked that the delay cannot be set for rate_connection_instantaneous connections and
    that delay and weight cannot be set for diffusion_connection connections.
