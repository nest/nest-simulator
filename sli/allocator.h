 * limit of large machines this is sufficient, because we rarely need
 * to grow synapse lists, as the majority of neurons have at most one
 * target per machine.
 * The allocator manages the pool of free memory in chunks that form a
 * linked list.  A head pointer keeps track of the next position in a
 * chunk to be handed to the caller of allocate. Once head reaches the
 * end of the current chunk, a new chunk is allocated from the OS and
