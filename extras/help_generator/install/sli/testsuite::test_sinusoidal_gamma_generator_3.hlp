Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_3 - Test parallel generation of sinusoidally modulate Gammaian trains with single spike train

Synopsis:

nest_indirect test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_3.sli ->	-


Description:

Creates a sinusoidally modulated Gamma generator emitting a 
single spike train to all of its targets and sends spikes to spike 
detector. Identical to ..._1, but with single generator, not one per VP.
